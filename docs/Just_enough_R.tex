\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

R makes it easy to work with and learn from data.

It also happens to be a complete programmming language, but if you're
reading this guide then that might not be of interest to you. That's OK
--- the goal here is \emph{not} to teach you how to program in
R\footnote{This is actually a lie, but I'm hoping you won't notice until
  it's too late.}. The goal is to teach you \emph{just enough R} to be
confident to explore your data.

In this guide, we use R in the same way we use any other statistics
software: To check and visualise data, run statistical analyses, and
share our results with others. To do that it's worth learning the
\emph{absolute basics} of the R language. The next few chapters walk you
through those basics: what you need to know to be productive in R and
RStudio.

By analogy, imagine going on holiday and learning enough French to
introduce yourself, count from one to ten, and order a baguette. You
won't be fluent - but you won't starve, and your trip will be more fun.

\paragraph{A warning}\label{a-warning}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{A warning}

This guide is extremely opinionated.

There are many ways to get things done with R, but trying to learn them
all at once causes unhappiness. In particular, lots of the base R
functions are old, quirky, inconstently named, and hard to remember.
This guide recommends that you use several new `packages' that replicate
and extend some of R's basic functionality.

Using this new set of packages, which are very thoughtfully designed and
work together nicely, will help you form a more consistent mental model
and workflow in R. You can learn the crufty old bits (which do still
have their uses) later on.

The guide also assumes you are using the
\protect\hyperlink{rstudio}{RStudio editor} and working in an
\protect\hyperlink{rmarkdown}{RMarkdown document} (see the next
section). This is important because this guide itself is written in
RMarkdown, and editing it will be an important part of the learning
process. If you don't have access to RStudio yet, see the
\href{installation.html}{installation guide}.

\section{Working with R}\label{r-basics}

\subsubsection*{Workflow}\label{start-here}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Workflow}

One of the biggest adjustments people need to make when moving away from
SPSS or other tools is to work out a `way of working'. Good students
often develop ways of working, saving and communicating their findings
that become habitual. These habits are often attempts to work around
limitations of these packages, so hopefully they will fade in time. But
nevertheless habits are easier to replace than break, so here's an
alternative model to adopt:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Work in RStudio, and specifically use RMarkdown documents (see
  \protect\hyperlink{rmarkdown}{next section})
\item
  Always keep your raw data in \protect\hyperlink{use-csv}{.csv format}.
\item
  Avoid saving multiple `processed' versions of your data, and never
  edit data by hand unless absolutely necessary.
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{save-intermediate-steps}{Use R to process data and
  RMarkdown to document the steps taken}.
\item
  `Knit' (run) your RMarkdown documents for sharing with colleagues, or
  for publication.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{rmarkdown}{\subsection*{RMarkdown}\label{rmarkdown}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{RMarkdown}

A major weakness of traditional GUI stats packages is that there is no
simple way to document and share your analyses, and so repeating or
editing your work later is very hard.

RMarkdown is a format for documenting and sharing statistical analyses,
and is one of the first things we learn in this guide. This it might
seem an odd place to start the guide: we haven't got anything to share
yet! But RMarkdown provides a really nice way to work with data
interactively, and share results, and so it's worth starting as we mean
to go on.

You are currently reading the output of an `RMarkdown' document.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R is a computer language designed for working with data.
\item
  Markdown is a simple text-based format which can include prose,
  hypertext links, images, and code (see
  \url{http://commonmark.org/help/}).
\end{itemize}

An RMarkdown document mixes R code with Markdown. This means you can
combine your analysis with text that explains and interprets it.
RMarkdown includes all the details neeed to reproduce an analysis.

Like computer code, RMarkdown can be `run' or `executed'. But in the
language of RStudio, you `knit' your RMarkdown to produce a finished
document. This combines analyses, graphs, and explanatory text in a
single pdf, html, or Word document which can be shared.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Writing and `knitting'
RMarkdown}{Writing and knitting RMarkdown}}\label{writing-and-knitting-rmarkdown}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Writing and `knitting' RMarkdown}

To include R code within RMarkdown we write 3 backticks
(\texttt{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}), followed
by \texttt{\{r\}}. We the include our R code, and close the block with 3
more backticks (\protect\hyperlink{backtick-location}{how to find the
backtick on your keyboard}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/r-code-chunk.png}
\caption{A code chunk in the RMarkdown editor}
\end{figure}

When a document including this chunk is run or `knitted', the final
result will include the the line \texttt{2+2} followed by the number
\texttt{4} on the next line. We can use RMarkdown to `show our
workings': our analysis can be interleaved with narrative text to
explain or interpret the calculations.

\hypertarget{rstudio}{\subsection*{RStudio}\label{rstudio}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{RStudio}

RStudio is a text editor which has been customised to make working with
R easy. It can be installed on your own computer, or you can login to a
shared RStudio server (for example, one run by your university) from a
web browser. Either way the interface is largely the same and contains 4
main panels:

\includegraphics[width=41.53in]{media/rstudio-mainwindow}

The figure above shows the main RStudio interface, comprising:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The main R-script or RMarkdown editor window. This is where you write
  commands, which can then be executed (to run the current line type
  ctrl-Enter or cmd-Enter on a Mac).
\item
  The R console, into which you can type R commands directly, and see
  the output of commands run in the script editor.
\item
  The `environment' panel, which lists all the variables you have
  defined and currently available to use.
\item
  The files and help panel. Within this panel the `files' tab enables
  you to open files stored on the server, in the current project, or
  elsewhere on your hard drive.
\end{enumerate}

You can see a short video demonstrating the RStudio interface here:

The video:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Shows you how to type commands into the Console and view the results.
\item
  Run a plotting function, and see the result.
\item
  Create RMarkdown file, and `Knit' it to produce a document containing
  the results of your code and explanatory text.
\end{itemize}

Once you have watched the video:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Try creating a new RMarkdown document in RStudio.
\item
  Edit some of the text, and press the Knit button to see the results.
\item
  If you feel brave, edit one of the R blocks and see what happens!
\end{itemize}

`chunk options' available to customise output,

here}

\href{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html}{see
this guide}

\subsection*{First commands}\label{first-commands}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{First commands}

You can type R commands directly into the console and see the result
there, but you should make a habit of working in an RMarkdown file. This
keeps a record of everything you try, and makes it easy to edit/amend
commands which don't work as you expect.

Now would be a good time to open an RMarkdown document to see how it
works. A good place to start would be to open the source to this
document. The best way to do this is to download the source code for the
`Just Enough R' project, and then open the file
\texttt{start\_here.Rmd}.

\paragraph{}\label{section-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

The source for this RMarkdown file is available here:
\url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/just-enough-r/master/start_here.Rmd}.

Or you can download the whole project here:
\url{https://github.com/benwhalley/just-enough-r/archive/master.zip}.
This link downloads a `zip' file, which is a compressed folder
containing all the files in the project. To `unzip' it on Mac or Windows
just double-click the file in the Finder or Windows Explorer.

\paragraph{}\label{section-2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

To run code in the RStudio interface put your cursor on a line within an
R Block (or select the code you want to run), and press
\texttt{Ctrl-Enter}. The result will appear below the code block.

The command in the R block below prints (shows on screen) the first few
rows of the build-in \texttt{mtcars} example dataset.

Place your cursor somewhere in the line the command is on and run it by
typing \texttt{Ctrl-Enter}, shown in this brief video:

Create an R block in RMarkdown, then run some simple commands.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\NormalTok{##                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1}
\NormalTok{## Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2}
\NormalTok{## Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you are reading this from within RStudio, running
\texttt{head(mtcars)} will have included an interactive table in the
document, which you can use this to view the \texttt{mtcars} dataset. If
you are still reading the compiled html or pdf document you will see a
table containing the same data, included within the body of the
document.

Hopefully at this point it's obvious that RStudio and RMarkdown give
you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A nice place to work with R and explore your data
\item
  A nice format to share your workings (e.g.~with other researchers or
  your tutor)
\item
  A mechanism to save reports of your analysis, to share with other
  people who don't use RStudio
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Naming things}\label{variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Naming things}

We can assign labels to the results of calculations and other parts of
our analyses to keep track of them.

To assign labels we use the \texttt{\textless{}-} symbol. The
\texttt{\textless{}-} symbol points from the value we want to store, to
the name we want to use. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{the_magic_number <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This assigns the value \texttt{3} to the variable
\texttt{the\_magic\_number}. This block wouldn't display anything
because assigning a variable doesn't create any output. To both assign a
variable \emph{and} display it we would type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{the_magic_number <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{3}
\NormalTok{the_magic_number}
\NormalTok{## [1] 3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or we can use a shortcut: if we wrap the line in parentheses this both
makes the assignment and prints the result to the console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(i_am_a_new_variable <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{22}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 22}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Helpfully, we can do calculations as we assign variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{one_score <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{20}
\NormalTok{(four_score_years_and_ten <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{one_score }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{4} \OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 90}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{We can give \emph{anything} a label by assigning it to a variable. It
doesn't have to be a number: we can also assign words, graphics and
plots, the results of a statistical model, or \emph{lists} of any of
these things.}

\hypertarget{vectors-and-lists}{\subsection*{Vectors and
lists}\label{vectors-and-lists}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Vectors and lists}

When working with data, we often have lists or sequences of `things'.
For example: a list of measurements we have made.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When all the things are of the same type, R calls this a
  \emph{vector}\footnote{It's actually a matrix if has 2 dimensions,
    like a table, or an array if it has more than 2 dimensions.}.
\item
  When there is a mix of different things R calls this a \emph{list}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Vectors}\label{vector}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Vectors}

We can create a vector of numbers and display it like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# this creates a vector of heights, in cm}
\NormalTok{heights <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{203}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{148}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{156}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{158}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{167}\NormalTok{, }
             \DecValTok{162}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{172}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{164}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{172}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{187}\NormalTok{, }
             \DecValTok{134}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{182}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{175}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{c()} command is shorthand for \emph{combine}, so the example
above combines the individual elements (numbers) into a new vector.

We can create a vector of alphanumeric names just as easily:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{names <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Ben"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Joe"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Sue"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Rosa"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can check the values stored in these variables by printing them.
You can either type \texttt{print(heights)}, or just write the name of
the variable alone, which will print it by default. E.g.:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{heights }
\NormalTok{##  [1] 203 148 156 158 167 162 172 164 172 187 134 182 175}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\paragraph{}\label{section-3}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

Try creating your own vector of numbers in a new code block
below\footnote{i.e.~edit the RMarkdown document} using the
\texttt{c(...)} command. Then change the name of the variable you assign
it to.

\hypertarget{access-vector-elements}{\subsubsection*{Accessing
elements}\label{access-vector-elements}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Accessing elements}

Once we have created a vector, we often want to access the individual
elements again. We do this based on their \emph{position}.

Let's say we have created a vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.vector <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{30}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{40}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can display the whole vector by just typing its name, as we saw
above. But if we want to show only the \emph{first} element of this
vector, we type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.vector[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{## [1] 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, the square brackets specify a \emph{subset} of the vector we want
- in this case, just the first element.

\subsubsection*{Selecting more than one
element}\label{selecting-more-than-one-element}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Selecting more than one element}

A neat feature of subsetting is that we can grab more than one element
at a time.

To do this, we need to tell R the \emph{positions} of the elements we
want, and so we provide a \emph{vector of the positions of the elements
we want}.

It might seem obvious, but the first element has position 1, the second
has position 2, and so on. So, if we wanted to extract the 4th and 5th
elements from the vector of heights we saw above we would type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{elements.to.grab <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{heights[elements.to.grab]}
\NormalTok{## [1] 158 167}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can also make a subset of the original vector and assign it to a
\emph{new} variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{first.two.elements <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{heights[}\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)]}
\NormalTok{first.two.elements}
\NormalTok{## [1] 203 148}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection*{Processing vectors}\label{processing-vectors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Processing vectors}

Many of R's most useful functions process \emph{vectors of numbers} in
some way. For example, if we want to calculate the average of our vector
of heights we just type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 167.6923}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

R contains \emph{lots} of built in functions which we can use to
summarise a vector of numbers. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{median}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 167}
\KeywordTok{sd}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 17.59443}
\KeywordTok{min}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 134}
\KeywordTok{max}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 203}
\KeywordTok{range}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 134 203}
\KeywordTok{IQR}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 17}
\KeywordTok{length}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 13}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

All of these functions accept a vector as input, do some proccesing, and
then return a \emph{single number} which gets displayed by RStudio.

But not all functions return a single number in the way that
\texttt{mean} did above. Some return a new vector, or some other type of
object instead. For example, the \texttt{quantile} function returns the
values at the 0, 25th, 50th, 75th and 100th percentiles (by default).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{height.quantiles <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{height.quantiles}
\NormalTok{##   0%  25%  50%  75% 100% }
\NormalTok{##  134  158  167  175  203}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If a function returns a vector, we can use it just like any other
vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{height.quantiles <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(heights)}

\CommentTok{# grab the third element, which is the median}
\NormalTok{height.quantiles[}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{## 50% }
\NormalTok{## 167}

\CommentTok{# assign the first element to a variable}
\NormalTok{min.height <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{height.quantiles[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{min.height}
\NormalTok{##  0% }
\NormalTok{## 134}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But other functions process a vector without returning any numbers. For
example, the \texttt{hist} function returns a histogram:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{hist}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{start_here_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-19-1.pdf}

We'll cover lots more plotting and visualisation later on.

\subsubsection*{Making new vectors}\label{making-new-vectors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Making new vectors}

So far we've seen R functions which process a vector of numbers and
produce a single number, a new vector of a different length (like
\texttt{quantile} or \texttt{fivenum}), or some other object (like
\texttt{hist} which makes a plot). However many other functions accept a
single input, do something to it, and return a single processed value.

For example, the square root function, \texttt{sqrt}, accepts a single
value and returns a single value: running \texttt{sqrt(10)} will return
\texttt{3.1623}.

In R, if a function accepts a single value as input and returns a single
value as output (like \texttt{sqrt(10)}), then you can usually give a
vector as input too. Some people find this surprising\footnote{Mostly
  people who already know other programming languages like C. It's not
  that surprising if you read the R code as you would English.}, but R
assumes that if you're processing a vector of numbers, you want the
function applied to each of them in the same way.

This turns out to be very useful. For example, let's say we want the
square root of each of the elements of our height data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# these are the raw values}
\NormalTok{heights}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 203 148 156 158 167 162 172 164 172 187 134 182 175}

\CommentTok{# takes the sqrt of each value and returns a vector of all the square roots}
\KeywordTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(heights)}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 14.24781 12.16553 12.49000 12.56981 12.92285 12.72792 13.11488}
\NormalTok{##  [8] 12.80625 13.11488 13.67479 11.57584 13.49074 13.22876}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This also works with simple arithmetic So, if we wanted to convert all
the heights from cm to meters we could just type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{heights }\OperatorTok{/}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{100}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 2.03 1.48 1.56 1.58 1.67 1.62 1.72 1.64 1.72 1.87 1.34 1.82 1.75}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{paste}{\paragraph{}\label{paste}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

This trick also works with other functions like \texttt{paste}, which
combines the inputs you send it to produce an alphanumeric string:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{paste}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Once"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"upon"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"a"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"time"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "Once upon a time"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we send a vector to \texttt{paste} it assumes we want a vector of
results, with each element in the vector pasted next to each other:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bottles <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{99}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{98}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"..."}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{paste}\NormalTok{(bottles, }\StringTok{"green bottles hanging on the wall"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "100 green bottles hanging on the wall"}
\NormalTok{## [2] "99 green bottles hanging on the wall" }
\NormalTok{## [3] "98 green bottles hanging on the wall" }
\NormalTok{## [4] "... green bottles hanging on the wall"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In other programming languages we might have had to write a `loop' to
create each line of the song, but R lets us write short statements to
summarise \emph{what} needs to be done; we don't need to worry worrying
about \emph{how} it gets done.

\paragraph{}\label{paste0}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

The \texttt{paste0} function does much the same, but leaves no spaces in
the combined strings, which can be useful:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{paste0}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"N="}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##  [1] "N=1"  "N=2"  "N=3"  "N=4"  "N=5"  "N=6"  "N=7"  "N=8"  "N=9"  "N=10"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsubsection*{Making up data (new
vectors)}\label{making-up-data-new-vectors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Making up data (new vectors)}

Sometimes you'll need to create vectors containing regular sequences or
randomly selected numbers.

To create regular sequences a convenient shortcut is the `colon'
operator. For example, if we type \texttt{1:10} then we get a vector of
numbers from 1 to 10:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}
\NormalTok{##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{seq} function allows you to create more specific sequences:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# make a sequence, specifying the interval between them}
\KeywordTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{from=}\FloatTok{0.1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{to=}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{by=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7}
\NormalTok{## [18] 1.8 1.9 2.0}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can also use random number-generating functions built into R to
create vectors:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# 10 uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1}
\KeywordTok{runif}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 0.4045490 0.5345472 0.4414659 0.4832063 0.2562126 0.2040762 0.6876566}
\NormalTok{##  [8] 0.4578561 0.1847851 0.8843672}

\CommentTok{# 1,000 uniformly distributed random numbers between 1 and 100}
\NormalTok{my.numbers <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{runif}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{# 10 random-normal numbers with mean 10 and SD=1}
\KeywordTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{mean=}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 11.342605 11.115379  9.036358  9.062017 10.748910  9.390587 10.194291}
\NormalTok{##  [8] 10.306759 10.127122  8.247792}

\CommentTok{# 10 random-normal numbers with mean 10 and SD=5}
\KeywordTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##  [1]  7.9126611 14.3523243 22.7525075 11.2225728  1.9833647 13.1075665}
\NormalTok{##  [7]  6.0708431  9.4363061  0.2478268 11.1413276}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then use these numbers in our code, for example plotting them:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{random.numbers <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10000}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{hist}\NormalTok{(random.numbers)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection*{Functions to learn now}\label{functions-to-learn-now}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Functions to learn now}

There are \emph{thousands} of functions built into R. Below are just a
few examples which are likely to be useful as you work with your data:

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# repeat something N times}
\KeywordTok{rep}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Apple pie"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{##  [18]  83  82  81  80  79  78  77  76  75  74  73  72  71  70  69  68  67}
\NormalTok{##  [35]  66  65  64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57  56  55  54  53  52  51  50}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Make sequences with steps of a particular size:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(tenths  <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{from=}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{to=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{by=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0}

\NormalTok{##  [1]  0.0000000  0.9090909  1.8181818  2.7272727  3.6363636  4.5454545}
\NormalTok{##  [7]  5.4545455  6.3636364  7.2727273  8.1818182  9.0909091 10.0000000}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Ranking

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# generate some random data (here, ages in years)}
\NormalTok{ages <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{round}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{mean=}\DecValTok{40}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{sd=}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{))}

\CommentTok{# get the rank order of elements (i.e. what their positions would be if the vector was sorted)}

\NormalTok{##  [1] 39 32 36 27 26 11 21 38 40 47}
\KeywordTok{rank}\NormalTok{(ages, }\DataTypeTok{ties.method=}\StringTok{"first"}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{## [1] 50}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Try and experiment with each of these functions. Check the output
against what you expected to happen, and make sure you understand what
they do.

\hypertarget{lists}{\subsection*{Lists}\label{lists}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Lists}

Try running the code below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(confusing.vector <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Wibble"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{## [1] "1"      "2"      "3"      "Wibble"}
\NormalTok{(first.element <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{confusing.vector[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{])}
\NormalTok{## [1] "1"}
\KeywordTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(first.element)}
\NormalTok{## Error in sqrt(first.element): non-numeric argument to mathematical function}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Take a minute to try and make a guess at what went wrong. Why does R
complain that the `\texttt{1}' is non-numeric?

When we built the vector we used \texttt{c} to combine the elements
\texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, \texttt{3} and \texttt{"Wibble"}. Although our
first three elements are numbers, \texttt{"Wibble"} is not - it's made
up of letters (this is called a character string).

Vectors can only contain one \emph{type} of thing so R automatically
converts all the elements to the same type, if it can.

Because R can't reliably convert \texttt{"Wibble"} to a number,
everything in the vector was converted to the \texttt{character} type
instead. We get an error because R can't mutiply words together.

If you're not sure what type of thing your vector contains, you can use
the \texttt{typeof} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{typeof}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "integer"}
\KeywordTok{typeof}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{runif}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{## [1] "double"}
\KeywordTok{typeof}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Wibble"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{## [1] "character"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here the meaning of \emph{integer} should be self explanatory. The
vector \texttt{runif(10)} has type \emph{double}, because it contains
`double-precision' floating point numbers. For our purposes you can just
think of \texttt{double} as meaning any number with decimal places.

The last vector has the type \texttt{character} because it includes the
character string \texttt{Wibble}, and all the other numbers in it were
coerced to become character strings too.

If we want to (safely) mix up different types of object without them
being converted we need a proper \texttt{list}, rather than a vector. In
R we would write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.list <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{list}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Wibble"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can still access elements from lists as we do for vectors, although
now we need to use double square brackets, for example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.list[[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]]}
\NormalTok{## [1] 2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But now our numbers haven't been converted to character strings, and we
can still multiply them.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.list[[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]] }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{my.list[[}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{]]}
\NormalTok{## [1] 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Square brackets are ugly and can be confusing though, so we often give
names to the elements of our list when we create it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.party <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{list}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{number.guests=}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }
                 \DataTypeTok{when=}\StringTok{"Friday"}\NormalTok{, }
                 \DataTypeTok{drinks =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Juice"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Beer"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Whisky"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Which means we can then access the elements \emph{by name} later on. To
do this, you write the name of the vector, then a \texttt{\$} sign, and
then the name of the element you want to access:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.party}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{when}
\NormalTok{## [1] "Friday"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You might have spotted that we included a vector inside the party list.
This is not a problem, and we can still access individual elements of
this vector too:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my.party}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{drinks[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{## [1] "Juice"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{datasets-dataframes}{\section{Datasets and
dataframes}\label{datasets-dataframes}}

A dataframe is an object which can store data as you might encounter it
in SPSS, Stata, or other statistics packages.

It's much like a spreadsheet, but with some constraints applied.
`Constraints' sound bad, but are helpful here: they make dataframes more
structured and predictable to work with:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Each column is a \protect\hyperlink{vectors-and-lists}{vector}, and so
  can \protect\hyperlink{vectors-and-lists}{only store one type of
  data}.
\item
  Every column has to be the same length (although missing values are
  allowed).
\item
  Each column should have a name.
\end{itemize}

Put another way, a dataframe behaves like a \emph{list} of
\emph{vectors}, which means we can use a lot of the same rules to
\protect\hyperlink{access-vector-elements}{access elements within them}
(more on this below).

in to R}. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(airquality)}
\NormalTok{##   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day}
\NormalTok{## 1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1}
\NormalTok{## 2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2}
\NormalTok{## 3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3}
\NormalTok{## 4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4}
\NormalTok{## 5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5}
\NormalTok{## 6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\NormalTok{##                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1}
\NormalTok{## Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2}
\NormalTok{## Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In both these examples the datasets (\texttt{airquality} and
\texttt{mtcars}) are already loaded and available to be used in the
\texttt{head()} function.

{To find a list of all the built in datasets you can type
\texttt{help(datasets)} or see
\url{https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html}.
Familiarise yourself with some of the other included datasets, e.g.
\texttt{datasets::attitude}. Watch out that not all the included
datasets are \emph{dataframes}: Some are just vectors of observations
(e.g.~the \texttt{airmiles} data) and some are `time-series', (e.g.~the
\texttt{co2} data)}

\subsection*{Looking at data}\label{looking-at-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Looking at data}

As we've already seen, using \texttt{print(df)} within an RMarkdown
document creates a nice interactive table you can use to look at your
data.

However you won't want to print your whole data file when you Knit your
RMarkdown document. The \texttt{head} function can be useful if you just
want to show a few rows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\NormalTok{##                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1}
\NormalTok{## Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2}
\NormalTok{## Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or we can use \texttt{glimpse()} function from the \texttt{dplyr::}
package (see the \protect\hyperlink{packages}{section on loading and
using packages}) for a different view of the first few rows of the
\texttt{mtcars} data. This flips the dataframe so the variables are
listed in the first column of the output:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## Observations: 32}
\NormalTok{## Variables: 11}
\NormalTok{## $ mpg  <dbl> 21.0, 21.0, 22.8, 21.4, 18.7, 18.1, 14.3, 24.4, 22.8, 19....}
\NormalTok{## $ cyl  <dbl> 6, 6, 4, 6, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, ...}
\NormalTok{## $ disp <dbl> 160.0, 160.0, 108.0, 258.0, 360.0, 225.0, 360.0, 146.7, 1...}

\NormalTok{## $ qsec <dbl> 16.46, 17.02, 18.61, 19.44, 17.02, 20.22, 15.84, 20.00, 2...}

\NormalTok{## $ gear <dbl> 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can use the \texttt{pander()} function (from the \texttt{pander::}
package) to format tables nicely, for when you Knit a document to HTML,
Word or PDF. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(pander)}
\KeywordTok{pander}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(airquality), }\DataTypeTok{caption=}\StringTok{"Tables always need a caption."}\NormalTok{)}

These plots might not be worth including in a final write-up, but are
very useful when exploring your data.

\subsubsection*{Using individual

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Using individual columns}

Because dataframes are like a list of vectors, we can access individual
columns using the \texttt{\$} symbol. This extracts the column as a
vector, so we can pass it to functions:

\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{mpg)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 20.09062}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or slice it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(first.mpg <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{mpg[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{])}
\NormalTok{## [1] 21}
\NormalTok{(worst.mpg <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{sort}\NormalTok{(mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{mpg)[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{])}
\NormalTok{## [1] 10.4}
\NormalTok{(best.mpg <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{rev}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{sort}\NormalTok{(mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{mpg))[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{])}
\NormalTok{## [1] 33.9}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{The problem with extracting individual columns in this way is that it's
easy for data to be taken out of context: for example, if you sort
individual columns then your data might get mixed up. In general if you
are accessing individual columns of data in this way it's a sign your
code may be brittle and vulnerable to errors. In later sections we
introduce methods for working on the whole dataset, which tends to be
safer.}

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Introducing the
\texttt{tidyverse}}{Introducing the tidyverse}}\label{tidyverse}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Introducing the \texttt{tidyverse}}

R includes hundreds of built-in ways to select individual elements, rows
or columns from a dataframe. This guide isn't going to teach you many of
them.

The truth is that R can be overwhelming to new users, especially those
new to programming. R is sometimes \emph{too} powerful and flexible:
there are too many different to accomplish the same end, and this can
lead to confusion.

Recently, a suite of packages has been developed for R which tries to
provide a simple, consistent set of tools for working with data and
graphics.

This suite of packages is called the \emph{tidyverse}, and you can load
all of these packages by calling:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this guide we make much use of two components from the tidyverse:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{dplyr}: to select, filter and summarise data
\item
  \texttt{ggplot2}: to make plots
\end{itemize}

It's strongly recommended that you use these in your own code.

\subsection*{Selecting columns}\label{selecting-columns}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Selecting columns}

Selecting a single column

Because dataframes act like lists of vectors, we can access columns from
them using the \texttt{\$} symbol. For example, here we select the
\texttt{Ozone} column, which returns a vector of the observations made:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{airquality}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{Ozone}
\NormalTok{##   [1]  41  36  12  18  NA  28  23  19   8  NA   7  16  11  14  18  14  34}
\NormalTok{##  [18]   6  30  11   1  11   4  32  NA  NA  NA  23  45 115  37  NA  NA  NA}
\NormalTok{##  [35]  NA  NA  NA  29  NA  71  39  NA  NA  23  NA  NA  21  37  20  12  13}
\NormalTok{##  [52]  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 135  49  32  NA  64  40  77}
\NormalTok{##  [69]  97  97  85  NA  10  27  NA   7  48  35  61  79  63  16  NA  NA  80}
\NormalTok{##  [86] 108  20  52  82  50  64  59  39   9  16  78  35  66 122  89 110  NA}
\NormalTok{## [103]  NA  44  28  65  NA  22  59  23  31  44  21   9  NA  45 168  73  NA}
\NormalTok{## [120]  76 118  84  85  96  78  73  91  47  32  20  23  21  24  44  21  28}
\NormalTok{## [137]   9  13  46  18  13  24  16  13  23  36   7  14  30  NA  14  18  20}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can pass this vector to functions, for example
\texttt{summary()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(airquality}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{Ozone)}
\NormalTok{##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's }
\NormalTok{##    1.00   18.00   31.50   42.13   63.25  168.00      37}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Selecting more than one column

To select multiple columns the \texttt{select()} function from
\texttt{dplyr} is the simplest solution. You give \texttt{select()} a
dataframe plus the names of the columns you want, and it returns a new
dataframe with just those columns, in the order you specified:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}
  \KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl, hp)}
\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##                   cyl  hp}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4           6 110}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4 Wag       6 110}
\NormalTok{## Datsun 710          4  93}
\NormalTok{## Hornet 4 Drive      6 110}
\NormalTok{## Hornet Sportabout   8 175}
\NormalTok{## Valiant             6 105}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Because all the main \texttt{dplyr} functions tend to return a new
dataframe, we can assign the results to a variable, and use that as
normal:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{cylandweight <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl, wt)}
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(cylandweight)}
\NormalTok{##       cyl              wt       }
\NormalTok{##  Min.   :4.000   Min.   :1.513  }
\NormalTok{##  1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:2.581  }
\NormalTok{##  Median :6.000   Median :3.325  }
\NormalTok{##  Mean   :6.188   Mean   :3.217  }
\NormalTok{##  3rd Qu.:8.000   3rd Qu.:3.610  }
\NormalTok{##  Max.   :8.000   Max.   :5.424}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can also put a minus (\texttt{-}) sign in front of the column name
to indicate which columns you don't want:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(airquality, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Ozone, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Solar.R, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Wind))}
\NormalTok{##   Temp Month Day}
\NormalTok{## 1   67     5   1}
\NormalTok{## 2   72     5   2}
\NormalTok{## 3   74     5   3}
\NormalTok{## 4   62     5   4}
\NormalTok{## 5   56     5   5}
\NormalTok{## 6   66     5   6}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can use a patterns to match a subset of the columns you want. For
example, here we select all the columns where the name contains the
letter \texttt{d}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(mtcars, }\KeywordTok{contains}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"d"}\NormalTok{)))}
\NormalTok{##                   disp drat}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4          160 3.90}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4 Wag      160 3.90}
\NormalTok{## Datsun 710         108 3.85}
\NormalTok{## Hornet 4 Drive     258 3.08}
\NormalTok{## Hornet Sportabout  360 3.15}
\NormalTok{## Valiant            225 2.76}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And you can combine these techniques to make more complex selections:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(mtcars, }\KeywordTok{contains}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"d"}\NormalTok{), }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{drat))}
\NormalTok{##                   disp}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4          160}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4 Wag      160}
\NormalTok{## Datsun 710         108}
\NormalTok{## Hornet 4 Drive     258}
\NormalTok{## Hornet Sportabout  360}
\NormalTok{## Valiant            225}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As a quick reference, you can use the following `verbs' to select
columns in different ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{starts\_with()}
\item
  \texttt{ends\_with()}
\item
  \texttt{contains()}
\item
  \texttt{everything()}
\end{itemize}

There are other commands too, but these are probably the most useful to
begin with. See the help files for more information.

\hypertarget{selecting-rows}{\subsection*{Selecting
rows}\label{selecting-rows}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Selecting rows}

To select particular rows from a dataframe, \texttt{dplyr} provides the
\texttt{filter()} function.

If we only want to see the 6-cylindered cars from the \texttt{mtcars}
dataframe:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl}\OperatorTok{==}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##    mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1 21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 2 21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 3 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## 4 18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## 5 19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 6 17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 7 19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{filter} function selects rows matching criteria you set: in
this case, that \texttt{cyl==6}. We can match two criteria at once if
needed:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl}\OperatorTok{==}\DecValTok{6} \OperatorTok{&}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{gear}\OperatorTok{==}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1 21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## 2 18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{`Operators'}{Operators}}\label{operators}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{`Operators'}

When selecting rows in the \protect\hyperlink{selecting-rows}{example
above} we used two equals signs \texttt{==} to compare values.

However, there are other operators we can use to create filters. Rather
than describe them, the examples below demonstrate what each of them do.

Equality and matching

To compare a single value we use \texttt{==}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{## [1] TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And in a filter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl}\OperatorTok{==}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##    mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1 21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 2 21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 3 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## 4 18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## 5 19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 6 17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 7 19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You might have noted above that we write \texttt{==} rather than just
\texttt{=} to define the criteria. This is because most programming
languages, including R, use two \texttt{=} symbols to distinguish:
\emph{comparison} from \emph{assignment}.

Presence/absence

To test if a value is in a vector of suitable matches we can use:
\texttt{\%in\%}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}
\NormalTok{## [1] TRUE}
\DecValTok{100} \OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}
\NormalTok{## [1] FALSE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And, perhaps less obviously, we can test whether each value in a vector
is in a second vector. This returns a vector of \texttt{TRUE/FALSE}
values as long as the first list:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] FALSE  TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And this is very useful in a dataframe filter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl }\OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)))}
\NormalTok{##    mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1 21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 2 21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## 3 22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1}
\NormalTok{## 4 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## 5 18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1}
\NormalTok{## 6 24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.190 20.00  1  0    4    2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Greater/less than

The \texttt{\textless{}} and \texttt{\textgreater{}} symbols work as
you'd expect:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl }\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{))}
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl }\OperatorTok{<}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can also use \texttt{\textgreater{}=} and \texttt{\textless{}=}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl }\OperatorTok{>=}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, cyl }\OperatorTok{<=}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Negation (opposite of)

The \texttt{!} is very useful to tell R to reverse an expression; that
is, take the opposite of the value. In the simplest example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{!}\OtherTok{TRUE}
\NormalTok{## [1] FALSE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This is helpful because we can reverse the meaning of other expressions:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(}\OtherTok{NA}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] TRUE}
\OperatorTok{!}\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(}\OtherTok{NA}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] FALSE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can use in filters. Here we select rows where \texttt{Ozone} is
missing (\texttt{NA}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(airquality, }\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(Ozone))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And here we use \texttt{!} to reverse the expression and select rows
which are not missing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(airquality, }\OperatorTok{!}\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(Ozone))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{Try running these commands for yourself and experiment with changing
the operators to make select different combinations of rows}

Other logical operators

There are operators for `and'/`or' which can combine other filters

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, hp }\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{200} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt }\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##    mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1 14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 2 16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3}
\NormalTok{## 3 10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 4 10.4   8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 5 14.7   8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 6 13.3   8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 7 15.8   8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50  0  1    5    4}
\NormalTok{## 8 15.0   8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60  0  1    5    8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Using \texttt{\&} (and) makes the filter more restrictive:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, hp }\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{200} \OperatorTok{&}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt }\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1 10.4   8  472 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 2 10.4   8  460 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 3 14.7   8  440 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally, you can set the order in which operators are applied by using
parentheses. This means these expressions are subtly different:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# first}
\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, (hp }\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{200} \OperatorTok{&}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt }\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{cyl}\OperatorTok{==}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1  18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2}
\NormalTok{## 2  14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 3  16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3}
\NormalTok{## 4  17.3   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60  0  0    3    3}

\hypertarget{sorting}{\subsection*{Sorting}\label{sorting}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Sorting}

You can sort dataframes with \texttt{arrange()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{airquality }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(Ozone) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

By default sorting is ascending, but you can use a minus sign to reverse
this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Ozone) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can sort on multiple columns too, but the order of the variables
makes a difference:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{pipes}{\subsection*{Pipes}\label{pipes}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Pipes}

We often want to combine \texttt{select} and \texttt{filter} (and other
functions) to return a subset of our original data.

As you might have noticed above, we can `nest' function calls in R. For
example, we might want to select specific columns and filter out some
rows.

Taking the \texttt{mtcars} data, we might want to select the weights of
only those cars with low \texttt{mpg}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gas.guzzlers <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mtcars, mpg }\OperatorTok{<}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{), wt)}
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(gas.guzzlers)}
\NormalTok{##        wt       }
\NormalTok{##  Min.   :3.570  }
\NormalTok{##  1st Qu.:3.840  }
\NormalTok{##  Median :5.250  }
\NormalTok{##  Mean   :4.686  }
\NormalTok{##  3rd Qu.:5.345  }
\NormalTok{##  Max.   :5.424}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This is OK, but can get quite confusing to read, and the more deeply
functions are nested the easier it is to make a mistake.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{dplyr} provides an alternative to
nested function calls, called the
pipe.}{dplyr provides an alternative to nested function calls, called the pipe.}}\label{dplyr-provides-an-alternative-to-nested-function-calls-called-the-pipe.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{\texttt{dplyr} provides an alternative

Imagine your dataframe as a big bucket containing data. From this
bucket, you can `pour' your data down through a series of tubes and
filters, until at the bottom of your screen you have a smaller bucket
containing just the data you want.

\begin{quote}
Think of your data `flowing' down the screen.
\end{quote}

To make data flow from one bucket to another, we use the `pipe'
operator: \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# dataframes are just 'buckets' of data}
\NormalTok{big.bucket.of.data <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{mtcars}

\NormalTok{big.bucket.of.data }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{<}\DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(wt) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{summary}
\NormalTok{##        wt       }
\NormalTok{##  Min.   :3.570  }
\NormalTok{##  1st Qu.:3.840  }
\NormalTok{##  Median :5.250  }
\NormalTok{##  Mean   :4.686  }
\NormalTok{##  3rd Qu.:5.345  }
\NormalTok{##  Max.   :5.424}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So we have achieved the same outcome, but the code reads as a series of
operations which the data flows through, connected by our pipes (the
\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}). At the end of the last pipe, our data gets
dumped into the \texttt{summary()} function\footnote{You might notice
  that when we write the \texttt{select} function we don't explicitly
  name the dataframe to be used. This is because R \emph{implicitly}
  passes the output of the pipe to the first argument of the function.
  So here, the output of \texttt{filter(mpg\textless{}15)} is used as
  the dataframe in the \texttt{select} function.}

We could just as well have saved this smaller `bucket' of data so we can
use it later on:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{smaller.bucket <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{big.bucket.of.data }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{<}\DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(wt)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This turns out to be an incredibly useful pattern when processing and
working with data. We can pour data through a series of filters and
other operations, saving intermediate states where necessary.

{You can insert the \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} symbol in RStdudio by
typing \texttt{cmd-shift-M}, which saves a lot of typing.}

\subsection*{Modifying and creating new columns}\label{mutate}

Each patients' PHQ-9 score is calculated by summing all of the
individual item scores. So - we want to create a new column containing
the sum of each row. This is fairly easy with the
\texttt{dplyr::mutate()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{phq9.scored.df <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{phq9.df }\OperatorTok{%>%}

\NormalTok{phq9.scored.df }\OperatorTok{%>%}

\NormalTok{## 6       2     0     4    21}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice that we first stored the computed scores in
\texttt{phq9.scored.df} and then used \texttt{select()} to get rid of
the raw data columns to display only what we needed.

Most tutorials and textbooks use neatly formatted example datasets to

be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the wrong format
\item
  Spread across multiple files

  Badly coded, or with errors

\hypertarget{importing-data}{\subsection*{Importing
data}\label{importing-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Importing data}

If you have data outside of R, \emph{the simplest way to import it is to
first save it as a comma or tab-separated text file}, normally with the
file extension \texttt{.csv} or \texttt{.txt}\footnote{This is easy to
  achieve in Excel and most other stats packages using the
  \texttt{Save\ As...} menu item}.

Let's say we have file called \texttt{angry\_moods.csv} in the same
directory as our \texttt{.Rmd} file. We can read this data using the
\texttt{read\_csv()} function from the \texttt{readr} package\footnote{There
  are also standard functions built into R, such as \texttt{read.csv()}
  or \texttt{read.table()} for importing data. These are fine if you
  can't install the \texttt{readr} package for some reason, but they are
  quite old and the default behaviour is sometimes counterintuitive. I
  recommend using the \texttt{readr} equivalents: \texttt{read\_csv()}
  or \texttt{read\_tsv()}.}:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As you can see, when loading the \texttt{.csv} file the
\texttt{read\_csv()} makes some assumptions about the \emph{type} of
data the file contains. In this case, all the columns contain integer
values. It's worth checking this message to make sure that stray cells
in the file you are importing don't cause problems when importing. Excel
won't complain about this sort of thing, but R is more strict and won't
mix text and numbers in the same column.

A common error is for stray notes or text values in a spreadsheet to
cause a column which should be numeric to be converted to the
\texttt{character} type.

Once it's loaded, you can use this new dataset like any other:

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Importing data over the web}

One neat feature of the \texttt{readr} package is that you can import
data from the web, using a URL rather than a filename on your local
computer. This can be really helpful when sharing data and code with
colleagues. For example, we can load the \texttt{angry\_moods.csv} file
from a URL:

This is often more trouble than it's worth. If using Excel for example,
it's best just to save your data a csv file first and import that.

But if you really must use other formats see
\url{https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-data-import-tutorial}.

\subsection*{Saving and exporting}\label{saving-and-exporting}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Saving and exporting}

Before you start saving data in csv or any other format, as yourself:
``Do I need to save \emph{this} dataset, or should I simply save my raw
data and code?''

Oftentimes it's best to keep only your raw datafiles, with the R code
you used to process them. This keeps your disk tidier, and avoids
confusion with multiple versions of files.

If it takes a long time to process your data though you might want to
save interim steps. And if you share your data (which you should) you
might also want to save simplified or anonymised versions of it, in
widely-accessible formats.

\hypertarget{use-csv}{\subsubsection*{Use CSV files}\label{use-csv}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Use CSV files}

Comma-separated-values files are a plain text format which are idea for
storing and sharing your data. They are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understood by almost every piece of software, ever
\item
  Will be readable in future
\item
  Perfect for storing 2D data (like dataframes)
\item
  Readable by humans (just open them in Notepad)
\end{itemize}

Commercial formats like Excel, SPSS (.sav) and Stata (.dta) don't have
these properties.

Although CSV has some disadvantages, they are all easily overcome if you

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you run this within an RMarkdown document, this will create the new
csv file in the same directory as your \texttt{.Rmd} file.

{You can also use the \texttt{write.csv()} function in base R, but this
version from \texttt{readr} is faster and has more sensible defalts
(e.g.~it doesn't write rownames, but does save column names in the first
row)}

\hypertarget{save-intermediate-steps}{\paragraph{Save processes, not
just outcomes}\label{save-intermediate-steps}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Save processes, not just outcomes}

Many students (and academics) make errors in their analyses because they
process data by hand (e.g.~editing files in Excel) or use GUI tools to
run analyses.

In both cases these errors are hard to identify or rectify because only
the outputs of the analysis can be saved, and \emph{no record has been
made of how these outputs were produced}.

In contrast, if you do your data processing and analysis in R/RMarkdown
you benefit from a concrete, repeatable series of steps which can be
checked/verified by others. This can also save lots of time if you need
to processing additional data later on (e.g.~if you run more
participants).

Some principles to follow when working:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Save your raw data in the simplest possible format, in CSV
\item
  Always include column names in the file
\item
  Use descriptive names, but with a regular strucuture.
\item
  Never include spaces or special characters in the column names. Use
  underscores (\texttt{\_}) if you want to make things more readable.
\item
  Make names \textless{}20 characters in length if possible
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Saving interim steps}\label{saving-interim-steps}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Saving interim steps}

If you are saving data to use again later in R, the best format is RDS.
Saving files to RDS \protect\hyperlink{rds-files}{is covered in a later
section (click to see)}.

If you are saving interim steps but think you might possibly want to
access it from other programmes in future use csv though.

To save something using RDS:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# create a huge df of random numbers... }
\NormalTok{massive.df <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{data_frame}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{nums =} \KeywordTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\FloatTok{1e6}\NormalTok{))}
\KeywordTok{saveRDS}\NormalTok{(massive.df, }\DataTypeTok{file=}\StringTok{"massive.RDS"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then later on you can load it like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{restored.massive.df <-}\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'massive.RDS'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{If you do this in RMarkdown, by default the RDS files will be saved in
the same directory as your .Rmd file.}

\subsubsection*{Archiving, publication and
sharing}\label{archiving-publication-and-sharing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Archiving, publication and sharing}

If you want to share data with someone else, or open it in a different
software package, using `.csv' format is strongly recommended unless
some other format is common in your field.

When archiving data, or sharing with others, you must document what each
column measures, and any processing steps used to create the file.
RMarkdown is a good way of doing this because it can combine the
processing with narrative explaining what is being done, and why.

\hypertarget{multiple-raw-data-files}{\subsection*{Dealing with multiple
files}\label{multiple-raw-data-files}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Dealing with multiple files}

Often you will have multiple data files files - for example, those
produced by \href{http://www.psychopy.org}{experimental software}.

This is one of the few times when you might have to do something
resembling `real programming', but it's still fairly straightforward.

In the \protect\hyperlink{trad-rm-anova}{repeated measures Anova example
later on in this guide} we encounter some data from an experiment where
reaction times were recorded in 25 trials (\texttt{Trial}) before and
after (\texttt{Time}) one of 4 experimental manipulations
(\texttt{Condition\ =\ \{1,2,3,4\}}). There were 48 participants in
total:

Let's say all the files are in a single directory, and numbered
sequentially. Using the \texttt{list.files()} function we can list the
contents of a directory on the hard drive:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{list.files}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'data/multiple-file-example/'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##  [1] "person1.csv"  "person10.csv" "person11.csv" "person12.csv"}
\NormalTok{##  [5] "person13.csv" "person14.csv" "person15.csv" "person16.csv"}
\NormalTok{##  [9] "person17.csv" "person18.csv" "person19.csv" "person2.csv" }
\NormalTok{## [13] "person20.csv" "person21.csv" "person22.csv" "person23.csv"}
\NormalTok{## [17] "person24.csv" "person25.csv" "person26.csv" "person27.csv"}
\NormalTok{## [21] "person28.csv" "person29.csv" "person3.csv"  "person30.csv"}
\NormalTok{## [25] "person31.csv" "person32.csv" "person33.csv" "person34.csv"}
\NormalTok{## [29] "person35.csv" "person36.csv" "person37.csv" "person38.csv"}
\NormalTok{## [33] "person39.csv" "person4.csv"  "person40.csv" "person41.csv"}
\NormalTok{## [37] "person42.csv" "person43.csv" "person44.csv" "person45.csv"}
\NormalTok{## [41] "person46.csv" "person47.csv" "person48.csv" "person5.csv" }
\NormalTok{## [45] "person6.csv"  "person7.csv"  "person8.csv"  "person9.csv"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{list.files()} creates a \protect\hyperlink{vectors}{vector} of
the names of all the files in the directory.

At this point, there are many, many ways of importing the contents of
these files, but below we use a technique which is concise, reliable,
and less error-prone than many others. It also continues to use the
\texttt{dplyr} library.

This approach has 3 steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Put all the names of the .csv files into a dataframe.
\item
  For each row in the dataframe, run a function which imports the file
  as a dataframe.
\item
  Combine all these dataframes together.
\end{enumerate}

Putting the filenames into a dataframe

Because \texttt{list.files} produces a vector, we can make them a column
in a new dataframe:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{raw.files <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{data_frame}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{filename =} \KeywordTok{list.files}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'data/multiple-file-example/'}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can make a new column with the complete path (i.e.~including the
directory holding the files), using the
\protect\hyperlink{paste}{\texttt{paste0}} which combines strings of
text. We wouldn't have to do this if the raw files were in the same
directory as our RMarkdown file, but that would get messy.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{raw.file.paths <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{raw.files  }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{filepath =} \KeywordTok{paste0}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/multiple-file-example/"}\NormalTok{, filename))}

\NormalTok{raw.file.paths }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 3 x 2}
\NormalTok{##       filename                                filepath}
\NormalTok{##          <chr>                                   <chr>}
\NormalTok{## 1  person1.csv  data/multiple-file-example/person1.csv}
\NormalTok{## 2 person10.csv data/multiple-file-example/person10.csv}
\NormalTok{## 3 person11.csv data/multiple-file-example/person11.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Using \texttt{do()}

We can then use the \texttt{do()} function in \texttt{dplyr::} to import
the data for each file and combine the results in a single dataframe.

The \texttt{do()} function allows us to run any R function for each
group or row in a dataframe.

The means that our original dataframe is broken up into chunks (either
groups of rows, if we use \texttt{group\_by()}, or individual rows if we
use \texttt{rowwise()}) and each chunk is fed to the function we
specify. This function must do it's work and return a new dataframe, and
these are then combined into a single larger dataframe.

So in this example, we break our dataframe of filenames up into
individual rows using \texttt{rowwise} and then specify the
\texttt{read\_csv} function which takes the name of a csv file, and
returns the content as a dataframe
(\protect\hyperlink{importing-data}{see the importing data section}).

For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{raw.data <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{raw.file.paths }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\CommentTok{# 'do' the function for each row in turn}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{rowwise}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{do}\NormalTok{(., }\KeywordTok{read_csv}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{file=}\NormalTok{.}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{filepath))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can check these data look OK by sampling 10 rows at random:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{raw.data }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{sample_n}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{pander}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Using custom functions with
\texttt{do()}}

In this example, each of the raw data files included the participant
number (the \texttt{person} variable). However, this isn't always the
case.

This isn't a problem though, if we create our own
\protect\hyperlink{helper-functions}{helper function} to import the
data. Writing small functions in R is very easy, and the example below
wraps the \texttt{read.csv()} function and adds a new colum,
\texttt{filename} to the imported data frame which would enable us to
keep track of where each row in the final combined dataset came from.

This is the helper function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{read.csv.and.add.filename <-}\StringTok{ }\ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{(filepath)\{}
  \KeywordTok{read_csv}\NormalTok{(filepath) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{filepath=}\NormalTok{filepath)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In English, you should read this as:

\begin{quote}
``Create a new R function called \texttt{read.csv.and.add.filename}
which expects to be passed a path to a csv file as an input. This
function reads the csv file at the path (converting it to a dataframe),
and adds a new column containing the original file path it read from. It
then returns this dataframe.''
\end{quote}

We can use our helper function with \texttt{do()} in place of the bare
\texttt{read\_csv} function we used before:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

At this point you might need to
\protect\hyperlink{extract-to-split-column-names}{use the
\texttt{extract()} or \texttt{separate()} functions} to post-process the
filename and re-create the \texttt{person} variable from this (although
in this case that's already been done for us).

\subsection{Joining different
datasets}\label{joining-different-datasets}

Many analyses combine data from different sources.

Even within a single study, you may find that you have different
datafiles (e.g.~spreadsheets) for different sorts of information. For
example you might have

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Multiple csv files output by experimental software.
\item
  A spreadsheet of demographic characteristics of participants
  (e.g.~their age, gender, handedness)
\item
  Questionnaire data, collected before the reaction time task.
\end{enumerate}

Your main analysis might want to model individual RTs using predictors
including age, handedness or some personality variable. Thus, you
probably want data which look something like this:

\paragraph{Joining the parts}\label{joining-the-parts}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Joining the parts}

To create the combined data file we want, we have to \emph{join} the
different files together.

As you might have noticed, though, the RT's file has many observations
per participant, whereas the demographics and personality data has one
row per person.

What we need is to smush this wide format data into the RTs file, such
that values get repeated for every row of each participants' data.

To do this, the simplest method is to use the
\texttt{dplyr::left\_join()} function:

In this example I explicitly set \texttt{id="person"} to let R know
which variable to use to match the rows of data, although you don't
\emph{have} to, and \texttt{dplyr} can normally guess. You \emph{do}
have to use the same variable name in both files though (so,
\texttt{person} and \texttt{participant} couldn't be matched, for
example).

\subparagraph{Other types of joins}\label{other-types-of-joins}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Other types of joins}

As the dplyr manual states: left joins return for two dataframes, x and
y will return all rows from x, and all columns from both x and y. Rows
in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there
are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches
are returned.

Left joins are probably the most useful, but there are other types which
can be useful. To see all of them look at the help files
(\texttt{help(\textquotesingle{}join\textquotesingle{},\ \textquotesingle{}dplyr\textquotesingle{})}).

To show one common example, if we wanted to check whether we were
missing RT data for one of our participants, we could use an
\texttt{anti\_join}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{anti_join}\NormalTok{(demographics, rts, }\DataTypeTok{by=}\StringTok{"person"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

This table lists the data for \emph{all the people in the demographics
file, for whom we don't have RT data}. This can be a useful way of
checking you haven't mislaid a raw datafile (e.g.~forgot to copy it from
the lab machine!).

\hypertarget{factors-and-numerics}{\subsection*{Types of
variable}\label{factors-and-numerics}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Types of variable}

When working with data in Excel or other packages like SPSS you've
probably become aware that different types of data get treated
differently.

For example, in Excel you can't set up a formula like \texttt{=SUM(...)}
on cells which include letters (rather than just numbers). It does't
make sensible.

However, Excel and many other programmes will sometimes make guesses
about what to do if you combine different types of data.

For example, in Excel, if you add \texttt{28} to \texttt{1\ Feb\ 2017}
the result is \texttt{1\ March\ 2017}. This is sometimes what you want,
but can often lead to
\href{http://www.sciencemag.org/news/sifter/one-five-genetics-papers-contains-errors-thanks-microsoft-excel}{unexpected
results and errors in data analyses}.

R is much more strict about not mixing types of data. Vectors (or
columns in dataframes) can only contain one type of thing. In general,
there are probably 4 types of data you will encounter in your data
analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Numeric variables
\item
  Character variables
\item
  Factors
\item
  Dates
\end{itemize}

The file \texttt{data/lakers.RDS} contains a dataset adapted from the
\texttt{lubridate::lakers} dataset (this is a dataset built into
\protect\hyperlink{packages}{an add-on package for R}).

This dataset contains four variables to illustrate the common variable
types (a subset of the original dataset which provides scores and other
information from each Los Angeles Lakers basketball game in the
2008-2009 season). We have the \texttt{date}, \texttt{opponent},
\texttt{team}, and \texttt{points} variables.

One thing to note here is that the \texttt{glimpse()} command tells us
the \emph{type} of each variable. So we have

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{points}: type \texttt{int}, short for integer (i.e.~whole
  numbers).
\item
  \texttt{date}: type \texttt{date}
\item
  \texttt{opponent}: type \texttt{chr}, short for `character', or
  alaphanumeric data
\item
  \texttt{team}: type \texttt{fctr}, short for factor and
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Differences in \emph{quantity}: numeric
variables}{Differences in quantity: numeric variables}}\label{differences-in-quantity-numeric-variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Differences in \emph{quantity}:
numeric variables}

We've already seem numeric variables in the section on
\protect\hyperlink{vectors}{vectors and lists}. These behave pretty much
as you'd expect, and we won't expand on them here.

\paragraph{}\label{section-8}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

There are different types of numeric variable. Integers (whole numbers)
are stored as type \texttt{int} but other types, like \texttt{dbl}, can
can store numbers with a decimal place. For most purposes (in doing
analyses of psychological data) the differences won't matter.

\hypertarget{character-and-factor}{\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Differences
in \emph{quality or
kind}}{Differences in quality or kind}}\label{character-and-factor}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Differences in \emph{quality or
kind}}

In many cases variables will be used to identify values which are
\emph{qualitatively different}. For example, different groups or
measurement occasions in an experimental study, or perhaps different
genders or countries in survey data.

In practice, these qualitative differences get stored in a range of
different variable types, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Numeric variables (e.g. \texttt{time\ =\ 1}, or
  \texttt{time\ =\ 2}\ldots{})
\item
  Character variables (e.g. \texttt{time\ =\ "time\ 1"},
  \texttt{time\ =\ "time\ 2"}\ldots{})
\item
  Boolean or logical variables (e.g. \texttt{time1\ ==\ TRUE} or
  \texttt{time1\ ==\ FALSE})
\item
  `Factors'
\end{itemize}

Storing categories as numeric variables can produce
\protect\hyperlink{factors-vs-linear-inputs}{confusing results when
running regression models}.

For this reason, it's normally best to store your categorical variables
as descriptive strings of letters and numbers (e.g. ``Treatment'',
``Control'') and avoid simple numbers (e.g.~1, 2, 3). Or as a factor.

\subsubsection{Factors for categorical
data}\label{factors-for-categorical-data}

Factors are R's answer to the problem of storing categorical data.
Factors assign one number for each unique value in a variable, and allow
you to attach a label to it.

This means the categories are stored as numbers `under the hood', but
you can also work with factors as though they were strings of letters
and numbers, and they display nicely when making tables and graphs.

For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}
\NormalTok{##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10}

\NormalTok{group.factor <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{group.factor}
\NormalTok{##  [1] 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10}
\NormalTok{## Levels: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}

\NormalTok{group.labelled <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{labels =} \KeywordTok{paste}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Group"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{group.labelled}
\NormalTok{##  [1] Group 1  Group 2  Group 3  Group 4  Group 5  Group 6  Group 7 }
\NormalTok{##  [8] Group 8  Group 9  Group 10}
\NormalTok{## 10 Levels: Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 Group 5 Group 6 ... Group 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can see this `underlying' number which represents each category by
using \texttt{as.numeric}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# note, there is no guarantee that "Group 1" == 1 (although it is here)}
\KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(group.labelled)}
\NormalTok{##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For simple analyses it's often best to store everything as the
\texttt{character} type (letters and numbers), but factors can still be
useful for making tables or graphs where the list of categories is known
and needs to be in a particular order. For more about factors, and lots
of useful functions for working with them, see the \texttt{forcats::}
package: \url{https://github.com/tidyverse/forcats}

\subsubsection*{Dates}\label{dates}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Dates}

Internally, R stores dates as the number of days since January 1, 1970.
This means that we can work with dates just like other numbers, and it
makes sense to have the \texttt{min()}, or \texttt{max()} of a series of
dates:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# the first few dates in the sequence}
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(lakers}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "2008-10-28" "2008-10-28" "2008-10-28" "2008-10-28" "2008-10-28"}
\NormalTok{## [6] "2008-10-28"}

\CommentTok{# first and last dates}
\KeywordTok{min}\NormalTok{(lakers}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "2008-10-28"}
\KeywordTok{max}\NormalTok{(lakers}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "2009-04-14"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Because dates are numbers we can also do arithmetic with them, and R
will give us a difference (in this case, in days):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{max}\NormalTok{(lakers}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date) }\OperatorTok{-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{min}\NormalTok{(lakers}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\NormalTok{## Time difference of 168 days}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, R does treat dates slightly differently from other numbers, and
will format plot axes appropriately, which is helpful (see more on this
in the \protect\hyperlink{graphics}{graphics section}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{hist}\NormalTok{(lakers}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date, }\DataTypeTok{breaks=}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{column-types-and-missing_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{missing}{\subsection*{Missing values}\label{missing}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Missing values}

Missing values aren't a data type as such, but are an important concept
in R; the way different functions handle missing values can be both
helpful and frustrating in equal measure.

Missing values in a vector are denoted by the letters \texttt{NA}, but
notice that these letters are unquoted. That is to say \texttt{NA} is
not the same as \texttt{"NA"}!

To check for missing values in a vector (or dataframe column) we use the
\texttt{is.na()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{nums.with.missing <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\OtherTok{NA}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{nums.with.missing}
\NormalTok{## [1]  1  2 NA}

\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(nums.with.missing)}
\NormalTok{## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here the \texttt{is.na()} function has tested whether each item in our
vector called \texttt{nums.with.missing} is missing. It returns a new
vector with the results of each test: either \texttt{TRUE} or
\texttt{FALSE}.

We can also use the negation operator, the \texttt{!} symbol to reverse
the meaning of \texttt{is.na}. So we can read \texttt{!is.na(nums)} as
``test whether the values in \texttt{nums} are NOT missing'':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# test if missing}
\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(nums.with.missing)}
\NormalTok{## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE}

\CommentTok{# test if NOT missing (note the exclamation mark in front of the function)}
\OperatorTok{!}\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(nums.with.missing)}
\NormalTok{## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can use the \texttt{is.na()} function as part of dplyr filters:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(Solar.R)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\paragraph{Complete cases}\label{complete-cases}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Complete cases}

Sometimes we want to select only rows which have no missing values ---
i.e. \emph{complete cases}.

The \texttt{complete.cases} function accepts a dataframe (or matrix) and
tests whether each \emph{row} is complete. It returns a vector with a
\texttt{TRUE/FALSE} result for each row:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{complete.cases}\NormalTok{(airquality) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{head}
\NormalTok{## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This can also be useful in dplyr filters. Here we show all the rows
which are \emph{not} complete (note the exclamation mark):

\paragraph{Missing data and R functions}\label{na.rm}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Missing data and R functions}

It's normally good practice to pre-process your data and select the rows
you want to analyse \emph{before} passing dataframes to R functions.

The reason for this is that different functions behave differently with
missing data.

For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(airquality}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{Solar.R)}
\NormalTok{## [1] NA}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here the default for \texttt{mean()} is to return NA if any of the
values are missing. We can explicitly tell R to ignore missing values by
setting \texttt{na.rm=TRUE}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(airquality}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{Solar.R, }\DataTypeTok{na.rm=}\OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] 185.9315}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In contrast some other functions, for example the \texttt{lm()} which
runs a linear regression will ignore missing values by default. If we
run \texttt{summary} on the call to \texttt{lm} then we can see the line
near the bottom of the output which reads: ``(7 observations deleted due
to missingness)''

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(Solar.R }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Temp, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{airquality) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{summary}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Call:}
\NormalTok{## lm(formula = Solar.R ~ Temp, data = airquality)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Residuals:}
\NormalTok{##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max }
\NormalTok{## -169.697  -59.315    6.224   67.685  186.083 }
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Coefficients:}
\NormalTok{##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    }
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)  -24.431     61.508  -0.397 0.691809    }
\NormalTok{## Temp           2.693      0.782   3.444 0.000752 ***}
\NormalTok{## ---}
\NormalTok{## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Residual standard error: 86.86 on 144 degrees of freedom}
\NormalTok{##   (7 observations deleted due to missingness)}
\NormalTok{## Multiple R-squared:  0.07609,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.06967 }
\NormalTok{## F-statistic: 11.86 on 1 and 144 DF,  p-value: 0.0007518}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{Normally R will do the `sensible thing' when there are missing values,
but it's always worth checking whether you do have any missing data, and
addressing this explicitly in your code}

\paragraph{Patterns of missingness}\label{patterns-of-missingness}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Patterns of missingness}

The \texttt{mice} package has some nice functions to describe patterns
of missingness in the data. These can be useful both at the exploratory
stage, when you are checking and validating your data, but can also be
used to create tables of missingness for publication:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mice}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{md.pattern}\NormalTok{(airquality) }
\NormalTok{##     Wind Temp Month Day Solar.R Ozone   }
\NormalTok{## 111    1    1     1   1       1     1  0}
\NormalTok{##  35    1    1     1   1       1     0  1}
\NormalTok{##   5    1    1     1   1       0     1  1}
\NormalTok{##   2    1    1     1   1       0     0  2}
\NormalTok{##        0    0     0   0       7    37 44}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this table, \texttt{md.pattern} list the number of cases with
particular patterns of missing data. - Each row describes a misisng data
`pattern' - The first column indicates the number of cases - The central
columns indicate whether a particular variable is missing for the
pattern (0=missing) - The last column counts the number of values
missing for the pattern - The final row counts the number of missing
values for each variable.

\subparagraph{Visualising missingness}\label{visualising-missingness}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Visualising missingness}

Graphics can also be useful to explore patterns in missingness.

\texttt{rct.data} contains data from an RCT of functional imagery
training (FIT) for weight loss, which measured outcome (weight in kg) at
baseline and two followups (\texttt{kg1}, \texttt{kg2}, \texttt{kg3}).
The trial also measured global quality of life (\texttt{gqol}).

As is common, there were some missing data at the follouwp:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fit.data <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/fit-weight.RDS"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(kg1, kg2, kg3, age, gqol1)}

\NormalTok{mice}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{md.pattern}\NormalTok{(fit.data)}
\NormalTok{##     kg1 age gqol1 kg2 kg3   }
\NormalTok{## 112   1   1     1   1   1  0}
\NormalTok{##   2   1   1     1   1   0  1}
\NormalTok{##   7   1   1     1   0   0  2}
\NormalTok{##   8   0   0     0   0   0  5}
\NormalTok{##       8   8     8  15  17 56}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We might be interested to explore patterns in which observations were
missing. Here we use colour to identify missing observations as a
function of the data recorded at baseline:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fit.data }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{missing.followup =} \KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(kg2)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(kg1, age, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{missing.followup)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{column-types-and-missing_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf}

There's a clear trend here for lighter patients (at baseline) to have
more missing data at followup. There's also a suggestion that younger
patients are more likely to have been lost to followup.

If needed, we could perform
\protect\hyperlink{common-inferential-stats}{inferential tests} for
these differences:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{t.test}\NormalTok{(kg1 }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(kg2), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{fit.data)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{##  Welch Two Sample t-test}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## data:  kg1 by is.na(kg2)}
\NormalTok{## t = 4.7153, df = 11.132, p-value = 0.000614}
\NormalTok{## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0}
\NormalTok{## 95 percent confidence interval:}
\NormalTok{##   7.005116 19.236238}
\NormalTok{## sample estimates:}
\NormalTok{## mean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE }
\NormalTok{##            90.59211            77.47143}
\KeywordTok{t.test}\NormalTok{(age }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{is.na}\NormalTok{(kg2), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{fit.data)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{##  Welch Two Sample t-test}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## data:  age by is.na(kg2)}
\NormalTok{## t = 1.2418, df = 6.5246, p-value = 0.2571}
\NormalTok{## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0}
\NormalTok{## 95 percent confidence interval:}
\NormalTok{##  -7.39455 23.25169}
\NormalTok{## sample estimates:}
\NormalTok{## mean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE }
\NormalTok{##            43.50000            35.57143}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, given the small number of missing values and the post-hoc
nature of these analyses these tests are rather underpowered and we
might prefer to report and comment on the plot alone.

For some nice missing data visualisation techniques, including those for
repeated measures data, see \citet{zhang2015missing}.

\hypertarget{tidying-data}{\subsection*{Tidying
data}\label{tidying-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Tidying data}

`Tidying' data means converting it into the format that is most useful
for data analyses, and so we have already covered many of the key
techniques: selecting and filtering data, reshaping and summarising.

However the ideas behind `tidying' draw together other related concepts
which link together the way we enter, store and process data: for
example the idea of `\href{}{relational data}' and techniques to join
together related datasets.

\paragraph{A philosophy of tidy data}\label{a-philosophy-of-tidy-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{A philosophy of tidy data}

The chapter on tidying in `R for data science' is well worth reading for
it's thoughtful explanation of why we want tidy data, and the core
techniques to clean up untidy data:

This section will probably require more attention than any other in the
guide, but will likely be one of the most useful things you learn in R.

As previously discussed, most things work best in R if you have data in
\emph{long format}. This means we prefer data that look like this:

In long format data:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  each row of the dataframe corresponds to a single measurement occasion
\item
  each column corresponds to a variable which is measured
\end{itemize}

Fortunately it's fairly easy to move between the two formats, provided
your variables are named in a consistent way.

\hypertarget{wide-to-long}{\paragraph{Wide to long
format}\label{wide-to-long}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Wide to long format}

This is the most common requirement. Often you will have several columns
which actually measure the same thing, and you will need to convert
these two two columns - a `key', and a value.

For example, let's say we measure patients on 10 days:

track of what was measured, and \texttt{value} which contains the score.

We can convert these back to the original wide format using
\texttt{dcast}, again in the \texttt{reshape2} package. The name of the
\texttt{dcast} function indicates we can `cast' a dataframe (the d
prefix). So here, casting means the opposite of `melting'.

Using \texttt{dcast} is a little more fiddly than \texttt{melt} because
we have to say \emph{how} we want the data spread wide. In this example
we could either have:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Columns for each day, with rows for each subject
\item
  Columns for each subject, with rows for each day
\end{itemize}

Although it's obvious to \emph{us} which format we want, we have to be
explicit for R to get it right.

We do this using a \protect\hyperlink{formulae}{formula}, which we'll
see again in the regression section.

Each formula has two sides, left and right, separated by the tilde
(\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}) symbol. On the left hand side we say which
variable we want to keep in rows. On the right hand side we say which
variables to convert to columns. So, for example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

For a more detailed explanation and various other methods for reshaping
data, see: \url{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html}

\subsubsection*{Aggregating and reshaping at the same
time}\label{aggregating-and-reshaping-at-the-same-time}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Aggregating and reshaping at the
same time}

One common trick when reshaping is to convert a datafile which has
multiple rows and columns per person to one with only a single row per
person. That is, we aggregae by using a summary (perhaps the mean) and
reshape at the same time.

Although useful this isn't covered in this section, because it is
combining two techniques:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reshaping (i.e.~from long to wide or back)
\item
  Aggregating or summarising (converting multiple rows to one)
\end{itemize}

In the next section we cover
\protect\hyperlink{summarising-data}{summarising data}, and introduce
the `split-apply-combine' method for summarising.

Once you have a good grasp of this, you could check out the
\protect\hyperlink{fancy-reshaping}{`fancy reshaping' section} which
does provide examples of aggregating and reshaping simultaneously.

Before you begin this section, make sure you have fully understood the
section on \href{datasets.html}{datasets and dataframes}, and in
particular that you are happy using the \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}
symbol to \protect\hyperlink{pipes}{describe a flow of data}.

The chapter outlines several different approaches to obtaining summary
statistics, and covers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Useful `utility' functions
\item
  Creating tables
\item
  Using \texttt{dplyr} as a generalisable tool to make any kind of
  summary
\end{itemize}

In particular, we emphasise functions that \emph{return dataframes}.

If a function returns a dataframe (rather than just printing output to
the screen) then we can continue to process and present these results in
useful ways.

\hypertarget{frequency-tables}{\subsubsection*{Frequency
tables}\label{frequency-tables}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Frequency tables}

Let's say we ask 4 year olds and 6 year olds whether they prefer lego or
duplo.

We can use the \texttt{table()} command to get a cross tabulation of
these \texttt{age} categories and what the child \texttt{prefers}. We
wrap \texttt{table(...)} in the \texttt{with()} function to tell it
which dataframe to use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lego.table <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{with}\NormalTok{(lego.duplo.df, }\KeywordTok{table}\NormalTok{(age, prefers))}
\NormalTok{lego.table}
\NormalTok{##          prefers}
\NormalTok{## age       duplo lego}
\NormalTok{##   4 years    38   20}
\NormalTok{##   6 years    12   30}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{xtab}}{xtab}}\label{xtab}

\texttt{table} is a simple way of calculating frequencies, but you can
also use the \texttt{xtabs} function to make more complex sumamries.

\texttt{xtabs} uses a formula type syntax to describe the table
(\protect\hyperlink{formulae}{formulas for linear models are explained
here}).

In the simplest case, we just write a tilde symbol
(\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}) and the the names of the variables we want
to tablulate, separated with \texttt{+} symbols:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{xtabs}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{age}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{prefers, lego.duplo.df)}
\NormalTok{##          prefers}
\NormalTok{## age       duplo lego}
\NormalTok{##   4 years    38   20}
\NormalTok{##   6 years    12   30}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The order of the variables changes the orientation of the table:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{xtabs}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{prefers}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{age, lego.duplo.df)}
\NormalTok{##        age}
\NormalTok{## prefers 4 years 6 years}
\NormalTok{##   duplo      38      12}
\NormalTok{##   lego       20      30}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Tables like this are useful in their own right, but can also be passed
to inferential tests, like \protect\hyperlink{crosstabs}{Chi squred}

\subsubsection*{Summary statistics}\label{summary-statistics}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary statistics}

In this guide so far you might have noticed functions which provide
summaries of an entire dataframe. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(angry.moods)}
\NormalTok{##      Gender          Sports        Anger.Out        Anger.In    }
\NormalTok{##  Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   : 9.00   Min.   :10.00  }
\NormalTok{##  1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:13.00   1st Qu.:15.00  }
\NormalTok{##  Median :2.000   Median :2.000   Median :16.00   Median :18.50  }
\NormalTok{##  Mean   :1.615   Mean   :1.679   Mean   :16.08   Mean   :18.58  }
\NormalTok{##  3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.:18.00   3rd Qu.:22.00  }
\NormalTok{##  Max.   :2.000   Max.   :2.000   Max.   :27.00   Max.   :31.00  }
\NormalTok{##   Control.Out      Control.In    Anger.Expression}
\NormalTok{##  Min.   :14.00   Min.   :11.00   Min.   : 7.00   }
\NormalTok{##  1st Qu.:21.00   1st Qu.:18.25   1st Qu.:27.00   }
\NormalTok{##  Median :24.00   Median :22.00   Median :36.00   }
\NormalTok{##  Mean   :23.69   Mean   :21.96   Mean   :37.00   }
\NormalTok{##  3rd Qu.:27.00   3rd Qu.:24.75   3rd Qu.:44.75   }
\NormalTok{##  Max.   :32.00   Max.   :32.00   Max.   :68.00}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{psych}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{describe}\NormalTok{(angry.moods, }\DataTypeTok{skew=}\OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##                  vars  n  mean    sd min max range   se}
\NormalTok{## Gender              1 78  1.62  0.49   1   2     1 0.06}
\NormalTok{## Sports              2 78  1.68  0.47   1   2     1 0.05}
\NormalTok{## Anger.Out           3 78 16.08  4.22   9  27    18 0.48}
\NormalTok{## Anger.In            4 78 18.58  4.70  10  31    21 0.53}
\NormalTok{## Control.Out         5 78 23.69  4.69  14  32    18 0.53}
\NormalTok{## Control.In          6 78 21.96  4.95  11  32    21 0.56}
\NormalTok{## Anger.Expression    7 78 37.00 12.94   7  68    61 1.47}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Although useful, these functions miss two important elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We have to operate on the whole dataframe at once
\item
  The output is just printed to screen. We might prefer to get back a
  dataframe so that we can process the results further.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Creating a data frame of summary
statistics}\label{creating-a-data-frame-of-summary-statistics}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Creating a data frame of summary
statistics}

Thanksfully, many summary functions allow us to pass their results to
the \texttt{as\_data\_frame()} function, which converts the output into
a table which we can use like any other dataset.

In this example, we create summary statistics with the
\texttt{psych::describe()} function, then convert to a dataframe and
format as a table in RMarkdown:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{psych}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{describe}\NormalTok{(angry.moods, }\DataTypeTok{skew=}\OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{as_data_frame }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\subparagraph{Rownames are evil}\label{rownames-are-evil}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Rownames are evil}

Historically `row names' were used on R to label individual rows in a
dataframe. It turned out that this is generally a bad idea, because
sorting and some summary functions would get very confused and mix up
row names and the data itself.

It's generally considered best practice to avoid row names, and store
everything as columns of data.

If you find that rownames in your data have disappeared,
\protect\hyperlink{rownames}{see this guide for turning them into an
extra column of data using \texttt{tibble::rownames\_to\_column()}}.

This is helpful, but there's no simple way to convert the result to a
dataframe, which we will want if we are creating tables for publication.

\texttt{describeBy} actually returns a list of tables, one for each
level of the \texttt{cyl} variable, so it is is possible to convert each
table in turn:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{summary.tables <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{psych}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{describeBy}\NormalTok{(mtcars, }\StringTok{'cyl'}\NormalTok{)}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 3 x 13}
\NormalTok{##    vars     n      mean        sd median   trimmed      mad   min   max}
\NormalTok{##   <int> <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>}
\NormalTok{## 1     1    11  26.66364  4.509828     26  26.44444  6.52344  21.4  33.9}
\NormalTok{## 2     2    11   4.00000  0.000000      4   4.00000  0.00000   4.0   4.0}
\NormalTok{## 3     3    11 105.13636 26.871594    108 104.30000 42.99540  71.1 146.7}
\NormalTok{## # ... with 4 more variables: range <dbl>, skew <dbl>, kurtosis <dbl>,}
\NormalTok{## #   se <dbl>}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But this is pretty yucky. Not only are the column names all mangled up,
but we also have to think about extracting each levell in turn, and need
to check how many levels in \texttt{cyl} there are. What happens if an
extra level gets added? Our code will likely break.

Thankfully there is much nicer and more consistent way to compute
exactly the summaries we want, sometimes termed the `split, apply,
combine' method.

\subsection*{A generalised approach}\label{a-generalised-approach}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A generalised approach}

\hypertarget{split-apply-combine}{\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{The `split,
apply, combine'
model}{The split, apply, combine model}}\label{split-apply-combine}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{The `split, apply, combine' model}

The \texttt{dplyr::} package, and especially the \texttt{summarise()}
function provides a generalised way to create dataframes of frequencies
and other summary statistics, grouped and sorted however we like.

For example, let's say we want the mean of some of our variables across
the whole dataframe:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{angry.moods }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}
    \DataTypeTok{mean.anger.out=}\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(Anger.Out), }
    \DataTypeTok{sd.anger.out=}\KeywordTok{sd}\NormalTok{(Anger.Out)}
\NormalTok{  )}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 1 x 2}
\NormalTok{##   mean.anger.out sd.anger.out}
\NormalTok{##            <dbl>        <dbl>}
\NormalTok{## 1       16.07692      4.21737}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{summarise} function has returned a dataframe containing the
statistics we need, although in this instance the dataframe only has one
row.

What if we want the numbers for men and women separately?

Utility functions like \texttt{describeBy} have options to do this (you
would specify grouping variables in that). But there's a more general
pattern at work --- we want to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Split} our data (into men and women, or some other
  categorisation)
\item
  \emph{Apply} some function to them (e.g.~calculate the mean) and then
\item
  \emph{Combine} it into a single table again (for more processing or
  analysis)
\end{itemize}

It's helpful to think of this \emph{split \(\rightarrow\) apply
\(\rightarrow\) combine} pattern whenever we are processing data because
it \emph{makes explicit what we want to do}.

\paragraph{Split: breaking the data into
groups}\label{split-breaking-the-data-into-groups}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Split: breaking the data into groups}

The first task is to organise our dataframe into the relevant groups. To
do this we use \texttt{group\_by()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{angry.moods }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(Gender) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{head}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 6 x 7}
\NormalTok{## # Groups:   Gender [2]}
\NormalTok{##   Gender Sports Anger.Out Anger.In Control.Out Control.In Anger.Expression}
\NormalTok{##    <int>  <int>     <int>    <int>       <int>      <int>            <int>}
\NormalTok{## 1      2      1        18       13          23         20               36}
\NormalTok{## 2      2      1        14       17          25         24               30}
\NormalTok{## 3      2      1        13       14          28         28               19}
\NormalTok{## 4      2      1        17       24          23         23               43}
\NormalTok{## 5      1      1        16       17          26         28               27}
\NormalTok{## 6      1      1        16       22          25         23               38}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Weirdly, this doesn't seem to have done anything. The data aren't sorted
by \texttt{Gender}, and there is no visible sign of the grouping, but
stick with it\ldots{}

\paragraph{Apply and combine}\label{apply-and-combine}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Apply and combine}

Continuing the example above, once we have grouped our data we can then
\emph{apply} a function to it --- for exmaple, summarise:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{angry.moods }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(Gender) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}
    \DataTypeTok{mean.anger.out=}\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(Anger.Out)}
\NormalTok{  )}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 2 x 2}
\NormalTok{##   Gender mean.anger.out}
\NormalTok{##    <int>          <dbl>}
\NormalTok{## 1      1       16.56667}
\NormalTok{## 2      2       15.77083}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And R and \texttt{dplyr} have done as we asked:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{split} the data by \texttt{Gender}, using \texttt{group\_by()}
\item
  \emph{apply} the \texttt{summarise()} function
\item
  \emph{combine} the results into a new data frame
\end{itemize}

If this were our data we might want to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculate the sum of the PHQ-9 variables (the PHQ-9 \emph{score})
\item
  Calculate the average PHQ-9 score at each month, and in each group
\item
  Show these means by group for months 0, 7 and 12
\end{itemize}

A `neater way'

You might have thought that typing out each variable in the above
example (\texttt{phq9\_01\ +\ phq9\_02...}) seemed a bit repetitive.

In general, if you find yourself typing something repetitive in R then
there \emph{will} a better way of doing it, and this is true here.

Stepping back, what we want is \emph{the row mean of all the variables
starting with \texttt{phq9\_0}}. We can write this more concisely like
so:

I've broken the code into multiple lines to make it clearer to read. In
English, this code means:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Take the the dataframe \texttt{phq9.df}
\item
  Add (using \texttt{mutate()}) a new variable called \texttt{phq} by
\item
  Calculating the rowmeans of selected columns in \texttt{phq9.df} which
\item
  Start with the letters: `phq9\_0
\end{enumerate}

{Ignore this if you are found the last section confusing, but if you
find pipes useful then note that I explicitly passed the
\texttt{phq9.df} directly to the \texttt{select()} function. There are
other tricks with pipes where you can pass the intermediate result of a
series of pipes to a function by putting a \texttt{.} (a full stop or
period) as the argument to the function. This can be very useful, so see
the \href{https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr}{package documentation
for details}.}

Here \texttt{dcast} has correctly guessed that \texttt{RT} is the value
we want to aggregate (you can specify explicitly with the
\texttt{value.var=} parameter).

\texttt{dcast} knows to aggregate using the mean because we set this
with the \texttt{agg.function} parameter; this just stands for
`aggregation function'.

We don't have to request the mean though: any function will do. Here we
request the SD instead:

Graphics are the best thing about R. The base system alone provides lots
of useful plotting functions, but the \texttt{ggplot2} package is
exceptional in the consistent and powerful approach it takes to
visualising data. This chapter focusses mostly on \texttt{ggplot}, but
does include some pointers to other useful plotting functions.

It's also worth pointing out here that the O'Reilly
\href{https://ase.tufts.edu/bugs/guide/assets/R\%20Graphics\%20Cookbook.pdf}{R
Graphics cookbook is available as a pdf download} and is a much more
comprehensive source than this page.

The examples below are more selective and show plots likely to be of
particular use in reporting your studies.

The emphaisis on showing you how to make \emph{good} plots that help you
explore data and communicate your findings, rather than simply reproduce
the output of SPSS or Excel.

\subsection*{Benefits of visualising data}\label{graphics-benefits}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Benefits of visualising data}

Scientists attempt to understanding natural processes, predict events in
the observable world, and communicate this understanding to others. In
each case, graphics are a powerful tool in their armoury.

The doctrine of null hypothesis testing which has infected psychology
and many other fields has made some researchers nervous about the power
of graphics to explore and find patterns in data: perhaps concerned with
the accusation of undertaking a `fishing trip' or capitalising on chance
in ther analyses, too many scientists have eschewed graphical statistics
and focussed instead on point estimates and \emph{p} values from complex
statistical models.

But as the complexity of theories group, the role of graphics becomes
ever more important because the \emph{right} graphical presentations of
our data are in many cases the only reliable way of checking the
appropriateness of our models, and of communicating our findings
efficiently.

David McCandless recently spoke at a TedX event about his work on data
journalism, and makes a persuasive case for paying more attention to
visualisations:

For a fascinating history and exploration of the good, the bad and the
ugly in data visualisations you should also (at least) skim Edward
Tufte's book \citep{edward2001visual}.

\subsection*{Which tool to use?}\label{graphics-approaches}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Which tool to use?}

Typically when setting out to plot data in R it pays to ask yourself
whether you need:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A quick way to visualise something specific -- for example to check
  some feature of your data before you continue your analysis -- without
  worrying \emph{too} much about the detail of the graphic.
\item
  A plot that is specifically designed to communicate your data
  effectively, and where you do care about the details of the final
  output.
\end{enumerate}

For the first case, where you already know what you want --- for example
to visualise a distribution of a single variable or to check diagnostics
from a linear model --- there are many useful built-in functions in
base-R.

For the second case --- for example where you want to visualise the main
outcomes of your study, or draw attention to specific aspects of your
data --- there is \texttt{ggplot2}. We'll deal with the second case
first, because using ggplot highlights many important aspects of
plotting in general.

\hypertarget{layered-graphics}{\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{Layered
graphics with
\texttt{ggplot}}{Layered graphics with ggplot}}\label{layered-graphics}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Layered graphics with \texttt{ggplot}}

If you've never given much thought to data visualisation before, you
might be surprised at the sheer variety of graphs types available.

One way to cut through the multitude of options is to determine what the
purpose of your plot is. Although not a complete list, it's likely your
plot will show at least one of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Relationships
\item
  Distributions
\item
  Comparison
\item
  Composition
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{ggplot} library makes it easy to produce high quality
graphics which serve these ends, and to layer them to produce
information-dense plots which are really effective forms of
communication.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}Examples of charts showing comaprisons,
relationships, distribution and composition. The comparison,
distribution and composition plots show 2 variables, but the
relationship plot includes 3, increasing the density of the information
displayed.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{A thought on `chart chooser'
guides}{A thought on chart chooser guides}}\label{a-thought-on-chart-chooser-guides}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{A thought on `chart chooser'
guides}

There are various simple chart selection guides available online, of
which these are quite nice examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2006/09/choosing_a_good.html}{Chart
  selection guide (pdf)}{]}
\item
  \href{https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf}{`Show
  me the numbers' chart guide (pdf)}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/choosing_a_good_chart.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\emph{However}, guides which attempt to be comprehensive and show you a
full range of plot types are perhaps not as useful as those which
reflect our knowledge of which plots are the most effective forms of
communication.

For example, almost all guides to plotting, and especially R textbooks,
will show you how to plot a simple bar graph. But bar graphs have
numerous disadvantages over other plots which can show the same
information.

Specifically, they:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  are low in information density (and so inefficient in use of space)
\item
  make comparisons between multiple data series very difficult (for
  example in \protect\hyperlink{understanding-interactions}{interaction
  plots}), and
\item
  perhaps most importantly, even when they include error bars, readers
  consistently misinterpret the quantitative information in bar graphs
  (specifically, when bar graphs are used to display estimates which
  contain error, readers assume points above the bar are less likely
  than points within the bar, even though this is typically not the
  case).
\end{itemize}

You should be guided in choosing plots not by mechanical rules based on
the number or type of variables you want to display. Instead, you should
be guided by the evidence from basic studies of human perception, and
applied data on how different types of infromation displays are really
used by readers.

This guide is restricted to examples likely to be useful and effective
for experiemental and applied psychologists.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Thinking like
\texttt{ggplot}}{Thinking like ggplot}}\label{thinking-like-ggplot}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Thinking like \texttt{ggplot}}

When using \texttt{ggplot} it helps to think of five separate steps to
making a plot (2 are optional, but commonly used):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Choose the data you want to plot.
\item
  Map variables to axes or other features of the plot (e.g.~sizes or
  colours).
\item
  (Optionally) use \texttt{ggplot} functions to summarise your data
  before the plot is drawn (e.g.~to calulate means and standard errors
  for point-range plots).
\item
  Add visual display layers.
\item
  (Optionally) Split the plot up across multiple panels using groupings
  in the data.
\end{enumerate}

You can then customise the plot labels and title, and tweak other
presentation parameters, although this often isn't necessary unless
sending a graphic for publication. You can also export graphics in
multiple high quality formats.

The simplest way to demonstrate these steps is with an example, and we
begin with a plot showing the relationship betwen variables:

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{`Relationships'}{Relationships}}\label{relationships}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{`Relationships'}

Problem to be solved: \emph{You want to check/show whether variables are
related in a linear fashion, e.g.~before running linear regression}

\subparagraph{Step 1: Select data to
plot}\label{step-1-select-data-to-plot}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Step 1: Select data to plot}

Step 1 is to select our data. As is typical in R, \texttt{ggplot} works
best with long-format data. In the examples below we will use the
\texttt{mtcars} dataset for convenience, so our first line of code is to
use the \texttt{dplyr} pipe symbol (operator) to send the
\texttt{mtcars} dataset to the next line of code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subparagraph{Step 2: Map variables to axes, colours, and other
features}\label{step-2-map-variables-to-axes-colours-and-other-features}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Step 2: Map variables to axes,
colours, and other features}

Step 2 is to map the variables we want to axes or other features of the
plot (e.g.~the colours of points, or the linetypes used in line plots).

The specify these mappings we use the \texttt{aes()} function, which is
slightly cryptic, but short for `aesthetics mapping'. Depending on the
plot type you will specify different aesthetics, and they can also have
different effects depending on the plot type, but you will commonly
specify:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{x} the variable to use as the x axis
\item
  \texttt{y} the variable to use as the y axis
\item
  \texttt{colour}: the variable to use to colour points or lines
\end{itemize}

Here we tell \texttt{ggplot} to use \texttt{disp} (engine size) on the x
axis, and \texttt{mpg} on the y axis. We also tell it to colour the
points differently depending on the value of \texttt{hp} (engine
horsepower).

At this point \texttt{ggplot} will create and label the axes and plot
area, but doesn't yet display any of our data. For this we need to add
visual display layers (in the next step).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ disp, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mpg, }\DataTypeTok{colour=}\NormalTok{hp))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

Other aesthetics

There are many other aesthetics which can be specified. Some of the most
useful are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{ymin} and \texttt{ymax}: for upper and lower bounds, e.g.~on
  error bars
\item
  \texttt{group}:which tells ggplot to group observations by some
  variable and, for example, plot a different line per-group)
\item
  \texttt{fill}: like \texttt{colour} but for areas/shapes
\item
  \texttt{alpha} and \texttt{size}: control the size and opacity of
  visual features (useful for de-emphasising some features of a plot to
  make others stand out)
\end{itemize}

See the ggplot documentation for more details:
\url{http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/\#section-aesthetics}

\subparagraph{Step 3}\label{step-3}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Step 3}

We skip step 3 for this example (asking ggplot to automatically make
summaries of our data before plotting), but will cover it below - see
the \texttt{stat\_summary()} function.

\subparagraph{Step 4: Display data}\label{step-4-display-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Step 4: Display data}

To display data, we have to add a visual layer to the plot. For example,
let's say we want to make a scatter plot, and so draw points for each
row of data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ disp, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mpg, }\DataTypeTok{colour=}\NormalTok{hp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

And we have a pretty slick graph: \texttt{ggplot} has now added points
for each pair of \texttt{disp} and \texttt{mpg} values, and coloured
them according to the value of \texttt{hp} (see choosing colours below
XXX).

{Use the \texttt{airquality} dataset and create your own scatterplot and
try to colour the points using the \texttt{Month} variable. Should
\texttt{Month} be used as a factor or a numeric variable when colouring
the points?}

What's even neater about \texttt{ggplot} though is how easy it is to
\emph{layer} different visualisations of the same data. These visual
layers are called \texttt{geom}'s and the functions which add them are
all prefixed with \texttt{geom\_}, so \texttt{geom\_point()} for scatter
plots, or \texttt{geom\_line()} for line plots, or
\texttt{geom\_smooth()} for a smoothed line plot. We can add this to the
scatter plot like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ disp, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mpg, }\DataTypeTok{colour=}\NormalTok{hp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size=}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{se=}\NormalTok{F, }\DataTypeTok{colour=}\StringTok{"grey"}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

In the example above, I have also customised the smoothed line, making
it grey to avoid over-intrusion into our perception of the points. Often
less is more when plotting graphs: not everything can be emphasised at
once, and \emph{it's important to make decisions about what should be
given visual priority}.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{Step 5: `Splitting up' or repeating the
plot.}{Step 5: Splitting up or repeating the plot.}}\label{step-5-splitting-up-or-repeating-the-plot.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Step 5: `Splitting up' or repeating
the plot.}

Very often, you will have drawn plot and think things like \emph{I
wonder what that would look like if I drew it for men and women
separately?}. In \texttt{ggplot} this is called facetting, and is easy
to achieve, provided your data are in a long format.

Using the same \texttt{mtcars} example, let's say we wanted separate
panels for American vs.~Foreign cars (information held in the
\texttt{am} variable). We simply add the \texttt{facet\_wrap()}, and
specify the \texttt{"am"} variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ disp, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mpg, }\DataTypeTok{colour=}\NormalTok{hp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size=}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{se=}\NormalTok{F, }\DataTypeTok{colour=}\StringTok{"grey"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{facet_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"am"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}

One trick is to make sure factors are labelled nicely, because these
labels appear on the final plot. Here the \texttt{mutate()} call
\href{real-data.html\#factors-and-numerics}{relabels the factor} which
makes the plot easier to read:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{american =} \KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(am, }\DataTypeTok{labels=}\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"American"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Foreign"}\NormalTok{))) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ disp, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ mpg, }\DataTypeTok{colour=}\NormalTok{hp)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\end{Shaded}

But we could present the same information more compactly, and with

Boxplots can also work well to show distributions, and have the

Because these data are in wide format (multiple columns have contain the
same type of data) we need to first convert to long format. This process
has become known as \href{http://tidyr.tidyverse.org}{tidying}.

The code below selects the columns related to rainfall and temperature
and then `melts' the data to long format: one row per observation. We
then \texttt{extract} the region and the type of measurement from the
\texttt{variable} column which is created by using a regular expression:

Try stepping through the code above line by line and see what is
produced at each step.

With our data in long form we can use \texttt{ggplot} to plot our data
over time. In the plot below, we use \texttt{filter()} to select only
the rainfall measurements:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rain <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{weather.data.long }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(variable}\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{'Rain'}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{rain }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(Year, value)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ylab}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Rainfall (mm)'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf}

There are many ways to extract structure from these data, and make
comparisons over time. One is to use colour:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rain }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(Year, value, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{Region)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ylab}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Rainfall (mm)'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-22-1.pdf}

It's now easy to see the crude differences between the regions (west
appears the driest, sw the wettest), but it's still hard to compare
between regions, or over time.

For this we can use various forms of summaries, for example a smoothed
line plot (the shaded area is the standard error), which clearly shows
the relative changes in rainfall in each region over time:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rain }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(Year, value, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{Region)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ylab}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Rainfall (mm)'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf}

It can sometimes be desireable to include points to preserve the
relationship between the summary and the raw data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rain }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(Region }\OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'west'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'se'}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(Year, value, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{Region)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{alpha=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{size=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{se=}\NormalTok{F) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ylab}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Rainfall (mm)'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-24-1.pdf}

If we weren't interested in the time series and just wanted to focus on
the most recent year, we might take a different approach. Here a bar
plot is used to compare between regions, with the national average (au)
highlighted in blue:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rain }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(Year }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{max}\NormalTok{(Year)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(Region, value, }\DataTypeTok{fill=}\NormalTok{Region}\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{"au"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{stat_summary}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{geom=}\StringTok{"bar"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ylab}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Rainfall (mm)'}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{guides}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{fill=}\NormalTok{F)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-25-1.pdf}

Finally, we shouldn't forget that this dataset included both rainfall
and temperature data, and we can display these in different ways,
depending on what our research question was.

In this case we can use facetting to display temperature and rainfall
data side by side. Because AVt and Rain are on such different scales we
need to allow the y axis to vary between variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{weather.data.long }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(Year, value, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{Region)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Waffle plots or `pictograms'}

Waffle plots are neat way of showing the relative frequency of different
categories.

In applied settings it's well known that when considering the risks or
benefits of interventions clinicans, patients and researchers benefit
from statements made using `natural frequencies'
\citep{gigerenzer2003simple}, and pictographs or `waffle plots' have
been shown to provide patients and their families with a better
understanding of the risks of treatments \citep{tait2010presenting}.

Waffle plots can be implemented in R via the \texttt{waffle::} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{outcomes <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"gained weight"}\NormalTok{=}\DecValTok{13}\NormalTok{, }
              \StringTok{"no change"}\NormalTok{=}\DecValTok{27}\NormalTok{, }
              \StringTok{"lost 2kg or more"}\NormalTok{ =}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{44}\NormalTok{, }
              \StringTok{"lost 5kg or more"}\NormalTok{ =}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{waffle}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{waffle}\NormalTok{(outcomes)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-27-1.pdf}

{Calculating these summary figures is left as an exercise to for the
reader, but see the section on
\protect\hyperlink{split-apply-combine}{summarising data with dplyr}.}

This is one of those occasions where the default ggplot colours could
probably be improved, and we can do this by passing the
\protect\hyperlink{named-colours}{names of the colours} we would like to
use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{weight.loss.colours <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'firebrick2'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'darkgoldenrod1'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'palegreen3'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'palegreen4'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{waffle}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{waffle}\NormalTok{(outcomes, }\DataTypeTok{colors =}\NormalTok{ weight.loss.colours)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-28-1.pdf}

Selecting colours by hand isn't always the best way though: the
\protect\hyperlink{color-brewer}{\texttt{colourbrewer} library provides
some nice shortcuts} for using palletes from the excellent
\href{http://colorbrewer2.org}{ColourBrewer website}.

When exploring a dataset, often useful to use built in functions or

Even for simple plots, ggplot has some useful helper functions though:

\subsubsection{Quantities}\label{quantities}

I don't think the base R plots are that convenient here.
\texttt{ggplot2::} and the \texttt{stat\_summary()} function makes life
much simpler:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(mtcars, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(cyl), mpg)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-37-1.pdf}

And if you are plotting quantities, as disussed above, showing a range
is sensible (a boxplot would also fill both definitions):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\hypertarget{facetting-plots}{\subsubsection*{More ways to facet a
plot}\label{facetting-plots}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{More ways to facet a plot}

Facets are ways to repeat a plot for each level of another variable.
\texttt{ggplot} has two ways of defining and displaying facets:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As a list of plots, using \texttt{facet\_wrap}.
\item
  As a grid or matrix of plots, using \texttt{facet\_grid()}.
\end{itemize}

Examples of both are shown below, using the following plot as a starting
point:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base.plot <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(mtcars, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(mpg, wt)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{()}
\NormalTok{base.plot}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics-ggplot-extras_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{facet\_wrap}}{facet\_wrap}}\label{facet_wrap}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\texttt{facet\_wrap}}

If we want one facet we just type the tilde (\texttt{\textasciitilde{}})
symbol and then the name of the variable. This is like typing the right
hand side of a \href{formulae}{formula for a regression model}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base.plot }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{facet_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{cyl)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics-ggplot-extras_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

If we want two facets we extend the formula, using the \texttt{+} sign:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base.plot }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{facet_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{cyl}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{am)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics-ggplot-extras_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

Note, the order of variables in the formula makes a difference:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base.plot }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{facet_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{am}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{cyl)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics-ggplot-extras_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{facet\_grid}}{facet\_grid}}\label{facet_grid}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\texttt{facet\_grid}}

With one variable \texttt{facet\_grid} produces similar output. Note the
\texttt{.} (period) on the left hand side of the formula now to make
explicit we only have one variable, and we want it on the x axis:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base.plot }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{facet_grid}\NormalTok{(.}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{cyl)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics-ggplot-extras_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

We can flip the facets around by putting the \texttt{cyl} variable on
the left hand side of the \texttt{\textasciitilde{}}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base.plot }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{facet_grid}\NormalTok{(cyl}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{.)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics-ggplot-extras_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf}

And \texttt{facet\_grid} can also create facets for two or more
variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base.plot }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{facet_grid}\NormalTok{(am}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{cyl)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{graphics-ggplot-extras_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

Here the labelling and the arrangement of plots is perhaps nicer because
it is clearer that plots for \texttt{cyl} are arrange left to right, and
for \texttt{am} they are top to bottom.

\subsubsection*{Combining separate plots in a
grid}\label{combining-plots}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Combining separate plots in a grid}

Note that combining separate plots in a grid is different from
\protect\hyperlink{facetting-plots}{facetting}, and it may be you want
that instead.

If you really want to combine several plots, the \texttt{gridExtra} and
\texttt{cowplot} packages can be helpful. This is the code from the

which may be a useful starting point:

\section{Example datasets}\label{example-datasets}

The

\hypertarget{common-inferential-stats}{\section{Common inferential

R has simple functions for common inferential statistics like
Chi\textsuperscript{2}, t-tests, correlations and many more. This
section is by no means exhaustive, but covers
\protect\hyperlink{crosstabs}{statistics for crosstabulations},
\protect\hyperlink{t-tests}{differences in means}, and
\protect\hyperlink{correlations}{linear correlation}.

For more on non-parametric statistics
\href{http://www.statmethods.net/stats/nonparametric.html}{this page on
the statmethods site} is a useful guide.

The
\href{http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/coin/doc/coin.pdf}{\texttt{coin::}
package} implements many resampling tests, which can also be useful when
assumptions of parametric tests are not valid.
\href{http://www.statmethods.net/stats/resampling.html}{See this intro
to resampling statistics}.

\hypertarget{crosstabs}{\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{Crosstabulations
and
\(\chi^2\)}{Crosstabulations and \textbackslash{}chi\^{}2}}\label{crosstabs}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Crosstabulations and \(\chi^2\)}

We saw in a previous section \protect\hyperlink{frequency-tables}{how to
create a frequency table of one or more variables}. Using that previous
example, assume we already have a crosstabulation of \texttt{age} and
\texttt{prefers}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lego.table}
\NormalTok{##          prefers}
\NormalTok{## age       duplo lego}
\NormalTok{##   4 years    38   20}
\NormalTok{##   6 years    12   30}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can easily run the inferential \(\chi^2\) (sometimes spelled ``chi'',
but pronounced ``kai''-squared) test on this table:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lego.test <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{chisq.test}\NormalTok{(lego.table)}
\NormalTok{lego.test}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{##  Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## data:  lego.table}
\NormalTok{## X-squared = 11.864, df = 1, p-value = 0.0005724}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we can access each number in this output individually because
the \texttt{chisq.test} function returns \protect\hyperlink{lists}{a
list}. We do this by using the \texttt{\$} syntax:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# access the chi2 value alone}
\NormalTok{lego.test}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{statistic}
\NormalTok{## X-squared }
\NormalTok{##  11.86371}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Even nicer, you can use an R package to write up your results for you in
APA format!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(apa)}
\KeywordTok{apa}\NormalTok{(lego.test, }\DataTypeTok{print_n=}\NormalTok{T)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "$\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}chi^2$(1, n = 100) = 11.86, *p* < .001"}

\subsubsection*{Three-way tables}\label{three-way-tables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Three-way tables}

You can also use \texttt{table()} or \texttt{xtabs()} to get 3-way
tables of frequencies (\texttt{xtabs} is probably better for this than
\texttt{table}).

For example, using the \texttt{mtcars} dataset we create a 3-way table,
and then convert the result to a dataframe. This means we can print the
table nicely in RMarkdown using the \texttt{pander.table()} function, or
process it further (e.g.~by \protect\hyperlink{sorting}{sorting} or
\protect\hyperlink{reshaping}{reshaping} it).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Correlations}

The base R \texttt{cor()} function provides a simple way to get Pearson
correlations, but to get a correlation matrix as you might expect from
SPSS or Stata it's best to use the \texttt{corr.test()} function in the
\texttt{psych} package.

Before you start though, plotting the correlations might be the best way
of getting to grips with the patterns of relationship in your data. A
pairs plot is a nice way of doing this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Month, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Day) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{pairs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{correlations_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

If we were satisfied the relationships were (reasonably) linear, we
could also visualise correlations themselves with a `corrgram', using
the \texttt{corrgram} library:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"corrgram"}\NormalTok{)}

         \DataTypeTok{upper.panel=}\NormalTok{panel.cor,}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

(above the diagonal), variable distributions (on the diagonal) and
ellipses and smoothed lines of best fit (below the diagnonal). Long,
narrow ellipses denote large correlations; circular ellipses indicate
small correlations.}
\end{figure}

The ggpairs function from the \texttt{GGally} package is also a nice way
of plotting relationships between a combination of categorical and
continuous data - it packs a lot of information into a limited space:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

One thing to be aware of is that by default \texttt{corr.test()}
produces p values that are adjusted for multiple comparisons in the top
right hand triangle (i.e.~above the diagonal). If you want the
uncorrected values use the values below the diagonal (or pass
\texttt{adjust=FALSE} when calling the function).

\subsubsection*{Working with correlation
matrices}\label{working-with-correlation-matrices}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Working with correlation matrices}

It's important to realise that, as with all R objects, we can work with
correlation matrices to continue our data ananalyses.

For example, as part of exploring your data, you might want to know
whether correlations you observe in one sample are similar to those from
another sample, when using the same questions. For example, let's say we
ran a survey measuring variables from the theory of planned behaviour
first in students, and later in older adults:

We could run correlations for each sample separately:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{corr.students <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{cor}\NormalTok{(students)}
\NormalTok{corr.public <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{cor}\NormalTok{(public)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we could `eyeball' both of these correlation matrices and try and
spot patterns or differences between them, but this is quite hard:

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{corr.students }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

Now it's much more obvious that the behaviour/control correlation
differs between the samples (it's higher in the students).

The point here is not that this is an analysis you are likely to
actually report --- although you might find it useful when exploring the
data and interpreting your findings.

But rather this show that a correlation matrix, in common with the
results of all the statistical tests we run, are themselves \emph{just
data points}. We can do whatever we like with our results --- storing
them in data frames to display later, or process as we need.

In reality, if you wanted to test the difference in correlations
(slopes) in two groups for one outcome variable you probably want to use
\protect\hyperlink{regression}{multiple regression}, and if you wanted
to test a complex model like the theory of planned behaviour, you might
consider \protect\hyperlink{cfa}{CFA} and/or
\protect\hyperlink{sem}{SEM}).

If you want to produce nice correlation tables for publication the
\texttt{apaTables} package might be useful. This block saves an APA
formatted correlation table to an \href{Table1_APA.doc}{external Word
document like this}.

Note though, that the APA table format does encourage `star gazing' to
some degree. Try to avoid interpreting correlation tables solely based
on the significance (or not) of the \emph{r} values. The \texttt{pairs}
or \texttt{corrgram} plots shown above are a much better summary of the
data, and are can be just as compact.

If you're not bothered about strict APA format, you might still want to
extract \emph{r} and \emph{p} values as dataframes which can then be
saved to a csv and opened in Excel, or converted to a table some other
way.

You can do this by storing the \texttt{corr.test} output in a variable,
and the accessing the \texttt{\$r} and \texttt{\$p} values within it.

First, we create the \texttt{corr.test} object:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mycorrelations <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{psych}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{corr.test}\NormalTok{(airquality)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then extract the \emph{r} values as a table:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mycorrelations}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{r }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{pander}\NormalTok{()}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Visualising your data first}

Before you run any tests it's worth plotting your data.

Assuming you have a continuous outcome and categorical (binary)
predictor (here we use a subset of the built in \texttt{chickwts} data),
a boxplot can work well:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{chicks.eating.beans <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{chickwts }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(feed }\OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"horsebean"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"soybean"}\NormalTok{))}

\NormalTok{chicks.eating.beans }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(feed, weight)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{t-tests_files/figure-latex/boxplot-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:boxplot}The box in a boxplot indictes the IQR; the
whisker indicates the min/max values or 1.5 imes the IQR, whichever is
the smaller. If there are outliers beyond 1.5 imes the IQR then they are
shown as points.}
\end{figure}

Or a violin or bottle plot, which shows the distributions within each
group and makes it relatively easy to check some of the main assumptions
of the test:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{chicks.eating.beans }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(feed, weight)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_violin}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{t-tests_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

Layering boxes and bottles can work well too because it combines
information about the distribution with key statistics like the median
and IQR, and also because it scales reasonably well to multiple
categories:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{chickwts }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subparagraph{Equal or unequal variances?}\label{equal-variances}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Equal or unequal variances?}

By default R assumes your groups have unequal variances and applies an
appropriate correction (you will notice the output labelled `Welch Two
Sample t-test').

You can turn this correction off (for example, if you're trying to
replcate an analysis done using the default settings in SPSS) but you
probably do want to assume unequal variances
\citep[see][]{ruxton2006unequal}.

\hypertarget{linear-models-simple}{\section{Regression}\label{linear-models-simple}}

\paragraph{}\label{section-13}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

This section assumes most readers will have done an introductory
statistics course and had some practice running multiple regression and
or Anova in SPSS or a similar package.

\hypertarget{formulae}{\subsubsection*{Describing statistical models
using formulae}\label{formulae}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Describing statistical models using
formulae}

R requires that you are explicit about the statistical model you want to
run but provides a neat, concise way of describing models, called a
\texttt{formula}. For multiple regression and simple Anova, the formulas
we write map closely onto the underlying \emph{linear model}. The
formula syntax provides shortcuts to quickly describe all the models you
are likely to need.

Formulas have two parts: the left hand side and the right hand side,
which are separated by the tilde symbol: \texttt{\textasciitilde{}}.
Here, the tilde just means `is predicted by'.

For example, this formula specifies a regression model where
\texttt{height} is the \emph{outcome}, and \texttt{age} and
\texttt{gender} are the \emph{predictor} variables.\footnote{I avoid the
  terms dependent/independent variables because they are confusing to
  many students, and because they are misleading when discussing
  non-experimental data.}

\begin{verbatim}
height ~ age + gender
\end{verbatim}

There are lots more useful tricks to learn when writing formulas, which
are covered below. But in the interests of instant gratification let's
work through a simple example first:

\subsubsection*{Running a linear model}\label{running-a-linear-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Running a linear model}

Linear models (including Anova and multiple regression) are run using
the \texttt{lm(...)} function, short for `linear model'. We will use the
\texttt{mtcars} dataset, which is built into R, for our first example.

First, we have a quick look at the data. The pairs plot suggests that
\texttt{mpg} might be related to a number of the other variables
including \texttt{disp} (engine size) and \texttt{wt} (car weight):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(mpg, disp, wt) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\NormalTok{pairs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

Before running any model, we should ask outselves: ``what question we
are trying to answer?''

In this instance, we can see that both weight (\texttt{wt}) and engine
size (\texttt{disp}) are related to \texttt{mpg}, but they are also
correlated with one another. We might want to know, then, ``are weight
and engine size independent predictors of \texttt{mpg}?'' That is, if we
know a car's weight, do we gain additional information about it's
\texttt{mpg} by measuring engine size?

To answer this, we could use multiple regression, including both
\texttt{wt} and \texttt{disp} as predictors of \texttt{mpg}. The formula
for this model would be \texttt{mpg\ \textasciitilde{}\ wt\ +\ disp}.
The command below runs the model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{disp, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Call:}
\NormalTok{## lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + disp, data = mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Coefficients:}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)           wt         disp  }
\NormalTok{##    34.96055     -3.35083     -0.01772}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For readers used to wading through reams of SPSS output R might seem
concise to the point of rudeness. By default, the \texttt{lm} commands
displays very little, only repeating the formula and listing the
coefficients for each predictor in the model.

So what next? Unlike SPSS, we must be explicit and tell R exactly what
we want. The most convenient way to do this is to first store the
results of the \texttt{lm()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{m.}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{ <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{disp, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This stores the results of the \texttt{lm()} function in a variable
named \texttt{m.1}. As an aside, this is a pretty terrible variable name
--- try to give descriptive names to your variables because this will
prevent errors and make your code easier to read.

We can then use other functions to get more information about the model.
For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(m.}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Call:}
\NormalTok{## lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + disp, data = mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Residuals:}
\NormalTok{##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max }
\NormalTok{## -3.4087 -2.3243 -0.7683  1.7721  6.3484 }
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Coefficients:}
\NormalTok{##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    }
\NormalTok{## (Intercept) 34.96055    2.16454  16.151 4.91e-16 ***}
\NormalTok{## wt          -3.35082    1.16413  -2.878  0.00743 ** }
\NormalTok{## disp        -0.01773    0.00919  -1.929  0.06362 .  }
\NormalTok{## ---}
\NormalTok{## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Residual standard error: 2.917 on 29 degrees of freedom}
\NormalTok{## Multiple R-squared:  0.7809, Adjusted R-squared:  0.7658 }
\NormalTok{## F-statistic: 51.69 on 2 and 29 DF,  p-value: 2.744e-10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Although still compact, the \texttt{summary} function provides some
familiar output, including the estimate, \emph{SE}, and \emph{p} value
for each parameter.

Take a moment to find the following statistics in the output above:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The coefficients and p values for each predictor
\item
  The \emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} for the overall model. What \% of
  variance in \texttt{mpg} is explained?
\end{itemize}

Answer the original question: `accounting for weight (\texttt{wt}), does
engine size (\texttt{disp}) tell us anything extra about a car's
\texttt{mpg}?'

\subsubsection*{More on formulas}\label{more-on-formulas}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{More on formulas}

Above we briefly introduced R's formula syntax. Formulas for linear
models have the following structure:

\begin{verbatim}
left_hand_side ~ right_hand_side
\end{verbatim}

For linear models \emph{the left side is our outcome}, which is must be
a continous variable. For categorical or binary outcomes you need to use
\texttt{glm()} function, rather than \texttt{lm()}. See the section on
\href{glm.html}{generalised linear models}) for more details.

\emph{The right hand side of the formula lists our predictors}. In the
example above we used the \texttt{+} symbol to separate the predictors
\texttt{wt} and \texttt{disp}. This told R to simply add each predictor
to the model. However, many times we want to specify relationships
\emph{between} our predictors, as well as between predictors and
outcomes.

For example, we might have an experiment with 2 categorical predictors,
each with 2 levels --- that is, a 2x2 between-subjects design.

Below, we define and run a linear model with both \texttt{vs} and
\texttt{am} as predictors, along with the interaction of \texttt{vs:am}.
We save this model as \texttt{m.2}, and use the \texttt{summary} command
to print the coefficients.

\begin{Shaded}

\paragraph{Other formula shortcuts}\label{other-formula-shortcuts}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Other formula shortcuts}

In addition to the \texttt{+} symbol, we can use other shortcuts to
create linear models.

As seen above, the colon (\texttt{:}) operator indicates the interaction
between two terms. So \texttt{a:b} is equivalent to creating a new
variable in the data frame where \texttt{a} is multiplied by \texttt{b}.

The \texttt{*} symbol indicates the expansion of other terms in the
model. So, \texttt{a*b} is the equivalent of \texttt{a\ +\ b\ +\ a:b}.

Finally, it's good to know that other functions can be used within R
formulas to save work. For example, if you wanted to transform your
dependent variable then \texttt{log(y)\ \textasciitilde{}\ x} will do
what you might expect, and saves creating temporary variables in your
dataset.

The formula syntax is very powerful, and the above only shows the
basics, but you can read the \texttt{formulae} help pages in RStudio for
more details.

Run the following models using the mtcars dataset:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  With \texttt{mpg} as the outcome, and with \texttt{cyl} and
  \texttt{hp} as predictors
\item
  As above, but adding the interaction of \texttt{cyl} and \texttt{hp}.
\item
  Repeat the model above, but write the formula a different way (make
  the formula either more or less explicit, but retaining the same
  predictors in the model).
\end{itemize}

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

If you store categorical data as numbers (e.g.~groups \texttt{1},
\texttt{2}, \texttt{3} \ldots{}) it's important to make sure your
predictors are entered correctly into your models.

In general, R works in a `regressiony' way and will assume variables in
a formula are linear predictors. So, a \texttt{group} variable coded
\texttt{1}\ldots{}\texttt{4} will be entered as a single parameter where
4 is considered twice as large as 2, etc.

See below for example. In the first model \texttt{cyl} is entered as a
`linear slope'; in the second each value of \texttt{cyl} (4,5, or 6) is
treated as a separate category. The predictions from each model could be
very different:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{linear.model <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{cyl, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars)}
\NormalTok{categorical.model <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(cyl), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the case of different experimental groups what you would normally
want is for \texttt{group} to be coded and entered as a number of
categorical parameters in your model. The most common way of doing this
is to use `dummy coding', and this is what R will implement by default
for \protect\hyperlink{character-and-factor}{character or factor
variables}.

To make sure your categorical variables are entered into your model as
categories (and not a slope) you can either:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Convert the variable to a character or factor type in the dataframe or
\item
  Specify that the variable is a factor when you run the model
\end{itemize}

For example, here we specify \texttt{cyl} is a factor within the model
formula:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(cyl), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Call:}
\NormalTok{## lm(formula = mpg ~ factor(cyl), data = mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Coefficients:}
\NormalTok{##  (Intercept)  factor(cyl)6  factor(cyl)8  }
\NormalTok{##       26.664        -6.921       -11.564}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Whereas here we convert to a factor in the original dataset:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{cyl.factor <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{cyl)}
\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{cyl.factor, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Call:}
\NormalTok{## lm(formula = mpg ~ cyl.factor, data = mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Coefficients:}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)  cyl.factor6  cyl.factor8  }
\NormalTok{##      26.664       -6.921      -11.564}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{Neither option is universally better, but if you have variables which
are \emph{definitely} factors (i.e.~should never be used as slopes) it's
probably better to convert them in the original dataframe, before you
start modelling}

\subsection*{Model specification}\label{parameterisation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Model specification}

It's helpful to think about regression and other statistical models as
if they were machines that do work for us --- perhaps looms in a cloth
factory. We feed the machines raw materials, and they busy themselves
producing the finished cloth. The nature of the finished cloth is
dependent on two factors: the raw material we feed it, and the setup and
configuration of the machine itself.

In regression (and Anova) the same is true: Our finished results are the
parameter estimates the model weaves from our raw data. The pattern we
see depends on the configuration of the machine, and it's important to
realise the same data can provide very different outputs depending on
the setup of the machine.

\paragraph{Equivalent models}\label{equivalent-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Equivalent models}

In some cases the `setup' of the machine produces changes which,
although they appear very different, are in fact equivalent in some
sense. Let's say our weaving machine produces a lovely set of rugs,
shown in the figure below:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/rugs1.jpg}
\caption{Rugs made in configuration 1}
\end{figure}

Now imagine that we flip all the standard settings on the weaving
machine. We feed the same raw materials to the loom, but the results
\emph{look} very different:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/rugs2.jpg}
\caption{Rugs made after configuration is changed}
\end{figure}

The second set of rugs are inversions of the first, \emph{but the
patterns remain the same}. The same sort of thing happens when we recode
variables before entering them in our regression models. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars))}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)          wt }
\NormalTok{##   37.285126   -5.344472}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can run a completely equivalent model if we `flip' the weight
(\texttt{wt}) coefficient by multiplying by \texttt{-1}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{wt.reversed  <-}\StringTok{ }\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{wt}
\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt.reversed, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars))}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept) wt.reversed }
\NormalTok{##   37.285126    5.344472}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

These models are equivalent in all the important ways: the test
statistics, p values are all the same: only the sign of the coefficient
for weight has changed.

The same kind of thing happens when we choose a
\protect\hyperlink{regression-coding}{different \emph{coding scheme} for
categorical variables (see section below)}: although the parameter
estimates change when the coding format thcnages, the \emph{underlying
model is equivalent because it would make the same predictions for new
data}.

\paragraph{Non-equivalent models}\label{non-equivalent-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Non-equivalent models}

In the case above we saw models which were equivalent in the sense that
they produced identical predictions for new observations.

Now we need to stretch our rug analogy a little, but imagine the output
of our machine is now an image of the northern lights, as in image A
below, but that by changing some settings of the machine, we might
instead produce image B:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/aurora.jpg}
\caption{Image credit:
\url{https://www.flickr.com/photos/undercrimson/13155461724}}
\end{figure}

You might reasonably ask why we would prefer image B or C to image A?
The answer is that, when running statistical models, we must remember
that they are always \emph{simplifications} of reality that are
(hopefully) \emph{useful} to us.

For example, our goal might be to use images of the northern lights to
track the position of the aurora in the sky. If so, we might find that
thresholding the picture in this way makes it easier to see where the
centre of mass of the light is. By smoothing out many of the `ripples'
and suface level patterning in the light, the overall shape becomes
clearer. And in fact this is one of the techniques computer vision
systems do use to pre-process image inputs.

Likewise, we face similar problems when analysing psychological data.
For example, when we measure an outcome repeatedly over a period of
seconds, days or months we are probably interested in the overall
\emph{shape} of the change, rather than in the suface-level patterning
of these changes.

Let's stretch the images analogy again and simplify the image above by
taking a single pixel high `slice' through the centre of each image (A,
B and C). In the figure below I've stretched these slices vertically so
that you can see the banding in the colour, but each of these images is
just a single pixel high:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/aurora-1-px.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Let's simplify this even further, and convert these images to greyscale:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/aurora-1-px-grey.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

We might think of these 3 images as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  `Raw' represents our raw data (image A above), and the greys represent
  the value of our `outcome' (intensity of light). The x-axis in this
  case is position in the sky, but could just as well be time or some
  other continuous variable.
\item
  `Threshold' represents some kind of categorical model for these data
  (akin to image B above), in which we `chunk' up the x-axis and make
  predictions for each chunk.
\item
  `Smooth' (akin to image C above) represents some kind of linear model
  with terms which represent the gradual changes in the outcome across
  the range of the x-axis (like \protect\hyperlink{polynomials}{slopes
  or polynomial terms in regression}).
\end{itemize}

Because a digital image is just a list of \texttt{intensity} values for
each pixel we can read the image into R and plot the raw values like any
other:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{intensity.vec <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{as.vector}\NormalTok{(png}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{readPNG}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'media/aurora-1-px-raw.png'}\NormalTok{))}

\NormalTok{aurora.image <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{data_frame}\NormalTok{(}
  \DataTypeTok{Intensity =}\NormalTok{ intensity.vec) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \KeywordTok{row_number}\NormalTok{())}

\NormalTok{aurora.image }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(x, Intensity)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-13}Plot of the intensity of light in the
single pixel slice from the Aurora image. Intensity of 1 corresponds to
white, and 0 to black in the original image.}
\end{figure}

We can fit linear models to these data, just like any other. So we migth
start by predicting intensity with a simple slope:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{aurora.linear <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(Intensity }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{x, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{aurora.image)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we could make predictions from this model and plot them against the
original:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{aurora.image }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{linear.prediction =} \KeywordTok{predict}\NormalTok{(aurora.linear)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{reshape2}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{melt}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{id.var=}\StringTok{'x'}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(x, value, }\DataTypeTok{group=}\NormalTok{variable, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{variable)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## Warning: attributes are not identical across measure variables; they will}
\NormalTok{## be dropped}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf}

As we can see, our predictions are pretty terrible, because the linear
model only allows for a simple slope over the range of \texttt{x}.

To improve the model, we can go in one of two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fit slopes and curves for \texttt{x}
\item
  Break \texttt{x} up into chunks
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Chunks}\label{chunks}

\NormalTok{## be dropped}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf}

That's somewhat better, although we can still see that the extremes of
our observed data are not well predicted by either the linear model (the
flat line) or the chunked model.

{Try cutting the \texttt{x} variable into more chunks. What are the pros
and cons of doing this? How many chunks would you need to reproduce the
original data faithfully?}

\paragraph{Slopes and curves}\label{slopes-and-curves}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Slopes and curves}

An alternative strategy at this point is to try and fit smooth curves
through the data. One way of doing this
(\protect\hyperlink{polynomials}{explained in greater detail in the
section on polynomials}) is to fit multiple parameters to represent the
initial slope, and then changes in slope, across the values of
\texttt{x}. In general, we need to fit one parameter for each change in
`direction' we want our cuve to take.

For example, we can fit a curve with 3 changes of direction by fitting
the `third degree' polynomial:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{aurora.curve <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(Intensity }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{poly}\NormalTok{(x, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{aurora.image)}

\NormalTok{aurora.image }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}
    \DataTypeTok{curve.prediction =} \KeywordTok{predict}\NormalTok{(aurora.curve)}
\NormalTok{  ) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{reshape2}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{melt}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{id.var=}\StringTok{'x'}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(x, value, }\DataTypeTok{group=}\NormalTok{variable, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{variable)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## Warning: attributes are not identical across measure variables; they will}
\NormalTok{## be dropped}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-17-1.pdf}

Or we could increase the number of parameters in our curve to allow a
tighter fit with the raw data and plot all the models together:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{aurora.curve <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(Intensity }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{poly}\NormalTok{(x, }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{aurora.image)}

    \DataTypeTok{chunked.prediction =} \KeywordTok{predict}\NormalTok{(aurora.chunks),}
    \DataTypeTok{curve.prediction =} \KeywordTok{predict}\NormalTok{(aurora.curve)}
\NormalTok{  ) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-18-1.pdf}

We can see that this curved model is a better approximation to the raw
data than our `chunked' model in some places (e.g.~x = 100), but worse
in others (e.g.~x = 625). Overall though, the R\textsuperscript{2} is
much higher for the curves model here:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(aurora.chunks)}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{r.squared}
\NormalTok{## [1] 0.4463338}
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(aurora.curve)}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{r.squared}
\NormalTok{## [1] 0.6162421}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And this is the case even though our model contains only 8 parameters,
and so is just as parsimonious as the chunked model above.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# count the number of parameters in the chunked and curved models}
\KeywordTok{length}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(aurora.chunks))}

\KeywordTok{length}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(aurora.curve))}
\NormalTok{## [1] 8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{Try to plot a curve that fits even more closely to the data. There are
1200 pixels in our original image. How many parameters would you need
for the model to fit the image exactly? What happens in practice if you
try and fit this model?}

For fun, we can even plot our data back in image form and see which is
closest to matching the original:

\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf}

{There is no `right answer' here: each model has pros and cons. You need
to think about what the purpose of your model is, how you want to
simplify your data, and then set up your models appropriately.}

\subsubsection*{Centering (is often helpful)}\label{centering}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Centering (is often helpful)}

When interpreting regression coefficients, and especially when
interactions are present in a model, it's often overlooked that the
regression parameters are the effect on the outcome of a 1-unit change
in the predictor, \emph{when all the other predictors are zero}. This
applies to the intercept too: it is the predicted value of the outcome
when \emph{all} of the predictors are zero.

This is unhelpful because it makes the intercept mostly meaningless, and
the other coefficients harder to interpret.

It's often a good idea to \emph{center} your predictors so that you can
interpret the intercept of the model as the average of your sample.

\subsubsection*{Scaling inputs}\label{scaling-regression-inputs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Scaling inputs}

Interpreting regression coefficients requires that we think in the
\emph{units} of the predictor.

For example, if we include `age in years' in our model, then this
\texttt{yob} coefficient gives us the change in the outcome for each
additional year.

However, we're often not interested in the effect of a single year. If
we are dealing with the effect of age in the general population, we're
unlikely to care about the effect of 1 year, and it might be more useful
and natural to think about 10-year differences in age. In contrast, if
our research is on adolescence, then the changes of the course of a year
might be too crude, and we may want to think about changes over months
instead.

It's important to realise there is no general or `correct' solution to
this problem. Regression models don't care about the scale of our
variables (within limits), but we do need to make choice about how we
scale inputs. These choices should aim to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  make regression coefficients easily interpretable and
\item
  make results comparable across studies
\end{itemize}

These two goals will not always be 100\% aligned, and there will be
tradeoffs needed as you select your strategy, which will normally be one
of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Putting coefficients on a `natural' scale or relate to meaningful
  quantities
\item
  Standardising coefficients.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{Using a `natural'
scale}{Using a natural scale}}\label{using-a-natural-scale}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Using a `natural' scale}

This will often mean just leaving your predictors `as-is', but it might
also mean dividing your predictor by some number to put it into more
convenient units. For example, dividing age in years by 10 would mean
that you can interpret the coefficient as the change over a decade,
which might be easier to think about.

\subparagraph{Standardising}\label{standardising}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Standardising}

Gelman \citep{gelman2008scaling} recommends standardising coefficients
by centering and dividing by two standard deviations. This can be useful
because binary variables like sex (male/female) will then be on a
\emph{similar} scale to numeric inputs.

However, be cautious when standardising. You will sometimes see people
interpret standardised coefficients in terms of `relative importance' of
the predictors. For example, they might say that if \(\beta^1 = .2\) and
\(\beta^2 = .4\) then \(\beta^2\) is twice as important as \(\beta^\).
Although this is appealing, it's not always valid.

The main problem is that you don't always know whether you have a full
range of values of predictors in your sample. For example, imagine a
case where the a regression coefficient for \texttt{age} was linear, and
= .5 in a sample from the general population.

We can plot these data to show the effect of age, and gender:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(incomes, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(age, income, }\DataTypeTok{group=}\NormalTok{gender, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{gender)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{se=}\NormalTok{F, }\DataTypeTok{method=}\StringTok{"lm"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{linear-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-24-1.pdf}

Older people earn more than younger people, and men earn slighly more
than women (in this simulated dataset), but this gender gap doesn't
change with age.

We can model this and print the effects of \texttt{age} and
\texttt{gender}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{m1 <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(income}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{age}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{gender, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{incomes)}
\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(m1)}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)         age     gender1 }
\NormalTok{## 30494.75486    30.75124  -486.30867}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can standardize these effects using the \texttt{stadardize}
function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(arm}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{standardize}\NormalTok{(m1))}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)       z.age    c.gender }
\NormalTok{##  31727.1240    920.5955    972.6173}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Based on these standardised coefficients we migth say that age and
gender are of roughly equal importance in predicting income.

If we re-fit the model on a subset of the data, for example only
individuals under 40, the regression coefficients won't change much
because the effect was constant across the range of ages:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{younger.incomes <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{incomes }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(age}\OperatorTok{<}\DecValTok{40}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{m2 <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(income}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{age}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{gender, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{younger.incomes)}
\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(m2)}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)         age     gender1 }
\NormalTok{##  30522.7491     29.6859   -525.4932}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But, the standardised coefficients \emph{do} change, because we have
restricted the range of ages in the sample:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{coef}\NormalTok{(arm}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{standardize}\NormalTok{(m2))}
\NormalTok{## (Intercept)       z.age    c.gender }
\NormalTok{##  31372.5885    542.2628   1050.9863}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The standardised effect of \texttt{age} is now roughly half that of
\texttt{gender}.

{The take home message here is that standardisation can be useful to put
predictors on a similar scale, but it's not a panacea and can't be
interpreted as a simple measure of `importance'. You still need to
think!}

\subsubsection*{Alternatives to
rescaling}\label{alternatives-to-rescaling}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Alternatives to rescaling}

A nice alternative to scaling the inputs of your regression is to set
aside the raw coefficients and instead make
\protect\hyperlink{predictions-and-margins}{predictions for values of
the predictors that are of theoretical or practical interest}. The
section on \protect\hyperlink{predictions-and-margins}{predictions and
marginal effects} has lots more detail on this.

\subsubsection*{What next}\label{what-next}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{What next}

\textbf{\emph{It is strongly recommended that you read the
\href{anova.html}{section on Anova} before doing anything else.}}

As noted above, R has a number of important differences in it's default
settings, as compared with packages like Stata or SPSS. These can make
important differences to the way you interpret the output of linear
models, especially Anova-type models with categorical predictors.

\hypertarget{anova}{\section{Anova}\label{anova}}

{Be sure to read the \protect\hyperlink{linear-models-simple}{section on
linear models in R} \emph{before} you read this section, and
specifically the parts on \protect\hyperlink{formulae}{specifying models
with formulae}.}

This section attempts to cover in a high level way how to specify anova
models in R and some of the issues in interpreting the model output. If
you need to revise the basic idea of an Anova, the Howell textbook
\citep{howell2016fundamental}. For a very quick reminder,
\href{http://web.utah.edu/stat/introstats/anovaflash.html}{this
interactive/animated explanation of Anova is helpful}.

If you just want the `answers' --- i.e.~the syntax to specify common
Anova models -- you could skip to the next section:
\protect\hyperlink{anova-cookbook}{Anova cookbook}

There are 4 rules for doing Anova in R and not wanting to cry:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Keep your data in `long' format.
\item
  Know the \protect\hyperlink{factors-and-numerics}{differences between
  character, factor and numeric} variables
\item
  Do not use the \texttt{aov()} or \texttt{anova()} functions to get an
  Anova table unless you know what you are doing.
\item
  Learn about the types of sums of squares and always remember to
  specify \texttt{type=3}, unless you know better.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Rules for using Anova in

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Rule 1: Use long format data}

In R, data are almost always most useful a long format where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  each row of the dataframe corresponds to a single measurement occasion
\item
  each column corresponds to a variable which is measured
\end{itemize}

For example, in R we will have data like this:

R always uses long form data when running an Anova, but one downside is
that it therefore has no automatic to know which rows belong to which
person (assuming individual people are the unit of error in your model).
This means that for repeated measures designs you need to make explicit
which measures are repeated when specifying the model (see the section
on repeated designs below).

\paragraph{Rule 2: Know your
variables}\label{rule-2-know-your-variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Rule 2: Know your variables}

See \protect\hyperlink{datasets-dataframes}{the section on dataframes}
and \protect\hyperlink{factors-and-numerics}{on the different column
types} and be sure you can distinguish:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Numeric variables
\item
  Factors
\item
  Character strings.
\end{itemize}

In Anova:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Outcomes will be numeric variables
\item
  Predictors will be factors or (preferably) character strings
\end{itemize}

If you want to run Ancova models, you can also add numeric predictors.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Rule 3: Don't use \texttt{aov()} or
\texttt{anova()}}{Rule 3: Don't use aov() or anova()}}\label{rule-3-dont-use-aov-or-anova}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Rule 3: Don't use \texttt{aov()} or
\texttt{anova()}}

This is the most important rule of all.

The \texttt{aov} and \texttt{anova} functions have been around in R a
long time. For various historical reasons the defaults for these
functions won't do what you expect if you are used to SPSS, Stata, SAS,
and most other stats packages. These differences are important and will
be confusing and give you misleading results unless you understand them.

The recommendation here is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If you have a factorial experiment define your model using
  \texttt{lm()} and then use \texttt{car::Anova()} to calculate F tests.
\item
  If you have repeated measures, your data are perfectly balanced, and
  you have no missing values then
  \protect\hyperlink{repeated-measures}{use \texttt{afex::car\_aov()}}.
\item
  If you think you want a repeated measures Anova but your data are not
  balanced, or you have missing data, use
  \protect\hyperlink{multilevel-models}{linear mixed models} instead via
  the \texttt{lme4::} package.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sums-squares}{\paragraph{Rule 4: Use type 3 sums of squares
(and learn why)}\label{sums-squares}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Rule 4: Use type 3 sums of squares (and
learn why)}

You may be aware, but there are at least 3 different ways of calculating
the sums of squares for each factor and interaction in an Anova. In
short,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  SPSS and most other packages use type 3 sums of squares.
\item
  \texttt{aov} and \texttt{anova} use type 1.
\item
  By default, \texttt{car::Anova} and \texttt{ez::ezANOVA} use type 2,
  but can use type 3 if you ask.
\end{itemize}

This means you must:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make sure you use type 3 sums of squares unless you have a reason not
  to.
\item
  Always pass \texttt{type=3} as an argument when running an Anova.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{}\label{section-15}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{}

A longer explanation of \emph{why} you probably want type 3 sums of
squares is given in this
\href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/60362/choice-between-type-i-type-ii-or-type-iii-anova}{online
discussion on stats.stackechange.com} and practical implications are
shown in \href{http://dwoll.de/rexrepos/posts/anovaSStypes.html}{this

An even longer answer, including a much deeper exploration of the
philosophical questions involved is given by

Let's say we asked people to taste 1 of 4 fruit juices, and rate how
tasty it was on a scale from 0 to 10:

\includegraphics{anova_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

We can run a oneway Anova with \protect\hyperlink{sums-squares}{type 3

\texttt{car::} package:

And we could \protect\hyperlink{contrasts}{compute the contasts} for
each fruit against the others (the grand mean):

{We found a significant main effect of juice, \emph{F}(3, 96) = 7.99,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001. Followup tests (adjusted for false discovery
rate) indicated that only Durian differed from the other juices, and was

We are using a

from Howell} \citep[chapter 13]{howell2012statistical}: an experiment
which recorded \texttt{Recall} among young v.s. older adults
(\texttt{Age}) for each of 5 conditions.

These data would commonly be plotted something like this:

\begin{Shaded}

\includegraphics{anova_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}

{Visual inspection of the data (see Figure X) suggested that older
adults recalled more words than younger adults, and that this difference
was greatest for the intention, imagery, and adjective conditions.
Recall peformance was worst in the counting and rhyming conditions.}

Or alternatively if we wanted to provde a better summary of the
distribution of the raw data we could use a boxplot:

\begin{Shaded}

We can run a linear model including the effect of \texttt{Age} and
\texttt{Condition} and the interaction of these variables, and calculate
the Anova:

\begin{Shaded}

It might be controversial to say so, but the tools to run traditional
repeat measures Anova in R are a bit of a pain to use. Although there
are numerous packages simplify the process a little, their syntax can be
obtuse or confusing. To make matters worse, various textbooks, online
guides and the R help files themselves show many ways to achieve the
same ends, and it can be difficult to follow the differences between the
underlying models that are run.

At this point, given the
\href{http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/481967}{many
other advantages of linear mixed models over traditional repeated
measures Anova}, and given that many researchers abuse traditional Anova
in practice (e.g.~using it for unbalanced data, or where some data are
missing), the recommendation here is to simply give up and learn how to
run linear mixed models. These can (very closely) replicate traditional
Anova approaches, but also:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Handle missing data or unbalanced designs gracefully and efficiently.
\item
  Be expanded to include multiple levels of nesting. For example,
  allowing pupils to be nested within classes, within schools.
  Alternatively multiple measurements of individual patients might be
  clustered by hospital or therapist.
\item
  Allow time to be treated as a continuous variable. For example, time
  can be modelled as a slope or some kind of curve, rather than a fixed
  set of observation-points. This can be more parsimonious, and more
  flexible when dealing with real-world data (e.g.~from clinical
  trials).
\end{itemize}

It would be best at this point to
\protect\hyperlink{multilevel-models}{jump straight to the main section
multilevel or mixed-effects models}, but to give one brief example of
mixed models in use:

If we want to test whether there are significant differences in RTs

If you really need to fit the traditional repeated measures Anova
(e.g.~your supervisor/reviewer has asked you to) then you should use
either the \texttt{afex::} or \texttt{ez::} packages.

Let's say we have an experiment where we record reaction 25 times
(\texttt{Trial}) before and after (\texttt{Time} = \{1, 2\}) one of 4
experimental manipulations (\texttt{Condition} = \{1,2,3,4\}). You have
12 participants in each condition and no missing data:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{anova_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf}

We want to use our repeated measurements before and after the
experimental interventions to increase the precision of our estimate of
the between-condition differences.

Our first step is to aggregate RTs for the multiple trials, taking the
mean across all trials at a particular \texttt{time}:

\begin{Shaded}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{RT=}\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(RT))}

\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(expt.data.agg)}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 6 x 4}
\NormalTok{## # Groups:   Condition, person [3]}
\NormalTok{##   Condition person   time       RT}
\NormalTok{##      <fctr> <fctr> <fctr>    <dbl>}
\NormalTok{## 1         1      1      1 260.8600}

\NormalTok{## 6         1      3      2 256.4459}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Because our data are still in long form (we have two rows per person),
we have to explicitly tell R that \texttt{time} is a within subject
factor. Using the \texttt{afex::} package we would write:

{These are the same models: any differences in the output are simply due
to rounding. You should use whichever of \texttt{ez::} and
\texttt{afex::} you find easiest to understand}

The \texttt{ges} column is the generalised eta squared effect-size
measure, which is preferable to the partial eta-squared reported by SPSS

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{But what about {[}insert favourite R
package for Anova{]}?}

Lots of people like \texttt{ez::ezANOVA} and other similar packages. My
problem with \texttt{ezANOVA} is that it doesn't use formulae to define
the model and for this reason encourages students to think of Anova as
something magical and separate from linear models and regression in
general.

This guide is called `just enough R', so I've mostly chosen to show only
\texttt{car::Anova} because I find this the most coherent method to
explain. Using formulae to specify the model reinforces a technique
which is useful in many other contexts. I've make an exception for
repeated because many people find specifying the error structure
explicitly confusing and hard to get right, and so \texttt{ez::} may be
the best option in these cases.

Although with a linear mixed model it would also be posible to analyse
the trial-by-trial data. Let's hypothesise, for example, that subjects
in Conditions 2 and 4 experienced a `practice effect', such that their
RTs reduced over multiple trials. If we plot the data, we can see this
suspicion may be supported (how conveninent!):

The significant \texttt{Condition:trial} term indicates that there was a
difference in the practice effects between the experimental conditions.

\paragraph{}\label{section-16}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

We found a significant interaction between condition and the linear term
for trial number, \emph{F}(3, 2340.18) = 10.83, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001. We explored this effect by plotting model-estimated reaction times
for each group for trials 1 through 25 (see Figure X): participants in
condition 2 and 4 exprienced a greater reduction in RTs across trial,
suggesting a larger practice effect for these conditions.

\paragraph{}\label{section-17}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

See the \protect\hyperlink{multilevel-models}{multilevel models section}
for more details, including analyses which allow the effects of
interventions to vary between participants (i.e., relaxing the
assumption that an intervention will be equally effective for all
participants).

\paragraph{RM Anova v.s. multilevel
models}\label{rm-anova-v.s.-multilevel-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{RM Anova v.s. multilevel models}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The RM Anova is perhaps more familiar, and may be conventional in your
  field which can make peer review easier (although in other fields
  mixed models are now expected where the design warrants it).
\item
  RM Anova requires complete data: any participant with any missing data
  will be dropped from the analysis. This is problematic where data are
  expensive to collect, and where data re unlikely to be missing at
  random, for example in a clinical trial. In these cases RM Anova may
  be less efficient and more biased than an equivalent multilevel model.
\item
  There is no simple way of calculating effect size measures like
  eta\textsuperscript{2} from the \texttt{lmer} model. This may or may
  not be a bad thing. \citet{baguley2009standardized}, for example,
  recommends reporting simple (rather than standardised) effect size
  measures, and is \protect\hyperlink{predictions-and-margins}{easily
  done by making predictions from the model}.

\section{General linear models}\label{general-linear-models}

Linear regression is suitable for outcomes which are continuous
numerical scores. In practice this requirement is often relaxed
slightly, for example for data which are slightly skewed, or where
scores are somewhat censored (e.g.~questionnaire scores which have a
minium or maximum).

However, for some types of outcomes standard linear models are
unsuitable. Examples here include binary (zero or one) or count data
(i.e.~positive integers representing frequencies), or proportions
(e.g.~proportion of product failures per batch). This section is
primarily concerned with binary outcomes, but many of the same
principles apply to these other types of outcome.

\hypertarget{logistic-regression}{\subsubsection*{Logistic
regression}\label{logistic-regression}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Logistic regression}

In R we fit logistic regression with the \texttt{glm()} function which
is built into R, or if we have a
\protect\hyperlink{multilevel-models}{multilevel model} with a binary
outcome we use \texttt{glmer()} from the \texttt{lme4::} package.

Fitting the model is very similar to linear regression, except we need
to specify the \texttt{family="binomial"} parameter to let R know what
type of data we are using.

Here we use the \texttt{titanic} dataset (you can download this from
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data}{Kaggle}, although you need
to sign up for an account).

Before we start fitting models, it's best to plot the data to give us a
feel for what is happening.

{Figure 1 reveals that, across all fare categories, women were more
likely to survive the disaster than men. Ticket class also appears to be
related to outcome: those with third class tickets were less likely to
survive than those with first or second class tickets. However,
differences in survival rates for men and women differed across ticket
classes: women with third class tickets appear to have been less
advantaged (compared to men) than women with first or second class
tickets.}

Given the plot above, it seems reasonable to predict survival from
\texttt{Sex} and \texttt{Pclass}, and also to include the interaction
between these variables.

To run a logistic regression we specify the model as we would with
\texttt{lm()}, but instead use \texttt{glm()} and specify the
\texttt{family} parameter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{m <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{glm}\NormalTok{(Survived }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Sex }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(Pclass), }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{helper-function-logistic}{\paragraph{}\label{helper-function-logistic}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

Because it can become repetitive to write out the \texttt{family}
parameter in full each time, I usually write a
\protect\hyperlink{helper-functions}{`helper function'} called
\texttt{logistic()} which simply calls \texttt{glm} with the right
settings. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# define a helper function for logistic regression the '...' }
\CommentTok{# means 'all arguments', so this function passes all it's }
\CommentTok{# arguments on to the glm function, but sets the family correctly}
\NormalTok{logistic <-}\StringTok{ }\ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{(...) \{}

Which you can use like so:

{Note that the Anova table for a \texttt{glm} model provides \(\chi^2\)

can interpret these \(\chi^2\) tests and \emph{p} values as you would
for F tests in a regular Anova.}

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Predictions after
\texttt{glm}}{Predictions after glm}}\label{glm-predictions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Predictions after \texttt{glm}}

As with linear models, we can make predictions from \texttt{glm} models
for our current or new data.

One twist here though is that we have to choose whether to make
predictions in units of the response (i.e.~probability of survival), or
of the transformed response (logit) that is actually the `outcome' in a
\texttt{glm} (see the \protect\hyperlink{link-functions}{explainer on
transformations and links functions}).

\emph{You will almost always want predictions in the units of your
response}, which means you need to add \texttt{type="response"} to the
\texttt{predict()} function call. Here we predict the chance of survival
for a new female passenger with a first class ticket:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{new.passenger =}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{expand.grid}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{Pclass=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{Sex=}\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"female"}\NormalTok{))}

\NormalTok{##         1 }
\NormalTok{## 0.9680851}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we could plot probabilities for each gender and class with a
standard error for this prediction if desired:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\paragraph{Evaluating logistic regression
models}\label{glm-cross-validation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Evaluating logistic regression models}

\texttt{glm} models don't provide an \emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}
statistic, but it is possible to evaluate how well the model fits the
data in other ways.

{Although there are various pseudo-\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}
statistics available for \texttt{glm}; see
\url{https://www.r-bloggers.com/evaluating-logistic-regression-models/}}

One common technique, however, is to build a model using a `training'
dataset (sometimes a subset of your data) and evaluate how well this
model predicts new observations in a `test' dataset. See
\url{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-assess.html} for an introduction.

\hypertarget{multilevel-models}{\section{Multilevel
models}\label{multilevel-models}}

Psychological data often contains natural \emph{groupings}. In
intervention research, multiple patients may be treated by individual
therapists, or children taught within classes, which are further nested
within schools; in experimental research participants may respond on
multiple occasions to a variety of stimuli.

Although disparate in nature, these groupings share a common
characteristic: they induce \emph{dependency} between the observations
we make. That is, our data points are \emph{not independently sampled}
from one another.

When data are clustered int his way then multilevel, sometimes called
linear mixed models, serve two purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  They overcome limitations of conventional models which assume that
  data \emph{are} independently sampled
  (\protect\hyperlink{clustering}{read a more detailed explanation of
  why handling non-independence properly matters})
\item
  They allow us to answer substantive questions about \emph{sources of
  variation} in our data.
\end{enumerate}

Repeated measures Anova and beyond

RM Anova is another technique which relaxes the assumption of
independent sampling, and is widely used in psychology: it is common
that participants make repeated responses which can be categorised by
various experimental variables (e.g.~time, condition).

However RM Anova is just a special case of a much wider family of
models: linear mixed models, but one which makes a number of
restrictions which can be invonvenient, inefficient, or unreasonable.

Substantive questions about variation

Additionally, rather than simply `managing' the non-independence of
observations --- treating it is a kind of nuisance to be eliminated ---
mixed models can allow researchers to focus on the sources of variation
in their data directly.

It can be of substantive interest to estimate
\protect\hyperlink{icc-and-vpc}{how much variation in the outcome is due
to different levels of the nested structure}. For example, in a clinical
trial researchers might want to know how much influence therapists have
on their clients' outcome: if patients are `nested' within therapists
then multilevel models can estimate the variation between therapists
(the `therapist effect') and variation `within' therapists
(i.e.~variation between clients).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Use \texttt{lmer} and
\texttt{glmer}}

Although there are mutiple R packages which can fit mixed-effects
regression models, the \texttt{lmer} and \texttt{glmer} functions within
the \texttt{lme4} package are the most frequently used, for good reason,
and the examples below all use these two functions.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{\emph{p} values in multilevel
models}{p values in multilevel models}}\label{p-values-in-multilevel-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\emph{p} values in multilevel
models}

For various philosophical and statistical reasons the author of lme4,
Doug Bates, has always refused to display \emph{p} values in the output
from lmer (his reasoning
\href{https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2006-May/094765.html}{is
explained here}).

That notwithstanding, many people have wanted to use the various methods
to calculate p values for parameters in mixed models, and calculate F
tests for effects and interactions. Various methods have been developed
over the years which address at least some of Bates' concerns, and these
techniques have been implemented in R in the \texttt{lmerTest::}
package. In particular, \texttt{lmerTest} implements an \texttt{anova}
function for \texttt{lmer} models, which is very helpful.

\subparagraph{}\label{section-18}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{}

\textbf{Don't worry!} All you need to do is to load the
\texttt{lmerTest} package rather than \texttt{lme4}. This loads updated
versions of \texttt{lmer}, \texttt{glmer}, and extra functions for
things like calculating \emph{F} tests and the Anova table.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{The \texttt{lmer} formula
syntax}{The lmer formula syntax}}\label{lmer-syntax}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{The \texttt{lmer} formula syntax}

Specifying \texttt{lmer} models is very similar to the
\protect\hyperlink{formulae}{syntax for \texttt{lm}}. The `fixed' part
of the model is exactly the same, with additional parts used to specify
\protect\hyperlink{random-intercepts}{random intercepts},
\protect\hyperlink{random-slopes}{random slopes}, and control the
covariances of these random effects
(\protect\hyperlink{controlling-lmer-covariances}{there's more on this
in the troubleshooting section}).

Random intercepts

The simplest model which allows a
\protect\hyperlink{random-intercepts}{`random intercept'} for each level
in the grouping looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(outcome }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{predictors }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{grouping), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here the outcome and predictors are specified in a formula, just as we
did when using \texttt{lm()}. The only difference is that we now add a
`random part' to the model, in this case:
\texttt{(1\textbar{}grouping)}.

The \texttt{1} refers to an intercept, and so in English this part of
the formula means `add a random intercept for each level of grouping'.

Random slopes

If we want to add a \protect\hyperlink{random-slopes-intercepts}{random
slope} to the model, we could adjust the random part like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(outcome }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{predictor }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(predictor }\OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{grouping), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This implicitly adds a random intercept too, so in English this formula
says something like: let \texttt{outcome} be predicted by
\texttt{predictor}; let variation in outcome to vary between levels of
\texttt{grouping}, and also allow the effect of \texttt{predictor} to
vary between levels of \texttt{grouping}.

The \texttt{lmer} syntax for the random part is very powerful, and
allows complex combinations of random intercepts and slopes and control
over how these random effects are allowed to correlate with one another.

covariance structures, see:

As noted in the \href{anova-cookbook.html}{Anova cookbook section},
repeated measures anova can be approximated using linear mixed models.

For example, reprising the

\includegraphics{multilevel-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

If we wanted to test whether there was significant variation in the
effects of sleep deprivation between subjects, by adding a
\protect\hyperlink{random-slopes-intercepts}{random slope} to the model.

The random slope allows the effect of \texttt{Days} to vary between
subjects. So we can think of an overall slope (i.e.~RT goes up over the
days), from which individuals deviate by some amount (e.g.~a resiliant
person will have a negative deviation or residual from the overall
slope).

Adding the random slope doesn't change the \emph{F} test for
\texttt{Days} that much:

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Nor the overall slope coefficient:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{random.slope.model.summary <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(random.slope.model)}
\NormalTok{slope.model.summary}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{coefficients}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But we can use the \texttt{lmerTest::rand()} function to show that there
is statistically significant variation in slopes between individuals,
using the likelihood ratio test:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lmerTest}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{rand}\NormalTok{(random.slope.model)}
\NormalTok{## Analysis of Random effects Table:}
\NormalTok{##              Chi.sq Chi.DF p.value    }
\NormalTok{## Days:Subject   42.8      2   5e-10 ***}

\NormalTok{## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Because the random slope for \texttt{Days} is statistically significant,
we know it improves the model. One way to see that improvement is to
plot residuals (unexplained error for each datapoint) against predicted
values. To extract residual and fitted values we use the
\texttt{residuals()} and \texttt{predict()} functions. These are then
combined in a data\_frame, to enable us to use ggplot for the subsequent
figures.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# create data frames containing residuals and fitted}
\CommentTok{# values for each model we ran above}
\NormalTok{a <-}\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{data_frame}\NormalTok{(}
    \DataTypeTok{model =} \StringTok{"random.slope"}\NormalTok{,}
    \DataTypeTok{fitted =} \KeywordTok{predict}\NormalTok{(random.slope.model), }

\NormalTok{b <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{data_frame}\NormalTok{(}

\CommentTok{# join the two data frames together}
\NormalTok{residual.fitted.data <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{bind_rows}\NormalTok{(a,b)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can see that the residuals from the random slope model are much more
evenly distributed across the range of fitted values, which suggests
that the assumption of homogeneity of variance is met in the random
slope model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

We can plot both of the random effects from this model (intercept and

\includegraphics{multilevel-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-14-1.pdf}

Inspecting this plot, there doesn't seem to be any strong correlation
between the RT value at which an individual starts (their intercept
residual) and the slope describing how they change over the days
compared with the average slope (their slope residual).

That is, we can't say that knowing whether a person has fast or slow RTs
at the start of the study gives us a clue about what will happen to them
after they are sleep deprived: some people start slow and get faster;
other start fast but suffer and get slower.

However we can explicitly check this correlation (between individuals'
intercept and slope residuals) using the \texttt{VarCorr()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(random.slope.model)}
\NormalTok{##  Groups   Name        Std.Dev. Corr }
\NormalTok{##  Subject  (Intercept) 24.7404       }
\NormalTok{##           Days         5.9221  0.066}
\NormalTok{##  Residual             25.5918}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The correlation between the random intercept and slopes is only 0.066,
and so very low. We might, therefore, want to try fitting a model
without this correlation. \texttt{lmer} includes the correlation by
default, so we need to change the model formula to make it clear we
don't want it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{uncorrelated.reffs.model <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(}
\NormalTok{  Reaction }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Days }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Subject) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0} \OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Days}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{Subject),  }
  \DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{lme4}\OperatorTok{::}\NormalTok{sleepstudy)}

\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(uncorrelated.reffs.model)}
\NormalTok{##  Groups    Name        Std.Dev.}
\NormalTok{##  Subject   (Intercept) 25.0513 }
\NormalTok{##  Subject.1 Days         5.9882 }
\NormalTok{##  Residual              25.5653}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The variance components don't change much when we constrain the
\emph{covariance} of intercepts and slopes to be zero, and we can
explicitly compare these two models using the \texttt{anova()} function,
which is somewhat confusingly named because in this instance it is
performing a likelihood ratio test to compare the two models:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{anova}\NormalTok{(random.slope.model, uncorrelated.reffs.model)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Model fit is not significantly worse with the constrained model,
\protect\hyperlink{over-fitting}{so for parsimony's sake we prefer it to
the more complex model}.

In theory, we could also fit additional parameters for the effect of
\texttt{Days}, although a combined smoothed line plot/scatterplot
indicates that a linear function fits the data reasonably well.

If we insisted on testing a curved (quadratic) function of
\texttt{Days}, we could:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, the \emph{p} value for \texttt{I(Days\^{}2)} is not significant,
suggesting (as does the plot) that a simple slope model is sufficient.

\hypertarget{icc-and-vpc}{\subsection*{Variance partition coefficients
and intraclass correlations}\label{icc-and-vpc}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Variance partition coefficients and
intraclass correlations}

The purpose of multilevel models is to partition variance in the outcome
between the different groupings in the data.

For example, if we make multiple observations on individual participants
we partition outcome variance between individuals, and the residual
variance.

We might then want to know what \emph{proportion} of the total variance
is attributable to variation within-groups, or how much is found
between-groups. This statistic is termed the variance partition
coefficient VPC, or intraclass correlation.

We calculate the VPC woth some simple arithmetic on the variance
estimates from the lmer model. We can extract the variance estimates
from the VarCorr function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{random.intercepts.model <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(Reaction }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Days }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{Subject),  }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{lme4}\OperatorTok{::}\NormalTok{sleepstudy)}
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(random.intercepts.model)}
\NormalTok{##  Groups   Name        Std.Dev.}
\NormalTok{##  Subject  (Intercept) 37.124  }
\NormalTok{##  Residual             30.991}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can test the variance parameter using the \texttt{rand()}
function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{rand}\NormalTok{(random.intercepts.model)}
\NormalTok{## Analysis of Random effects Table:}
\NormalTok{##         Chi.sq Chi.DF p.value    }
\NormalTok{## Subject    107      1  <2e-16 ***}
\NormalTok{## ---}
\NormalTok{## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Helpfully, if we convert the result of \texttt{VarCorr} to a dataframe,
we are provided with the columns \texttt{vcov} which stands for
\texttt{variance\ or\ covariance}, as well as the \texttt{sdcor}
(standard deviation or correlation) which is provided in the printed
summary:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(random.intercepts.model) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{as_data_frame}\NormalTok{()}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 2 x 5}

\NormalTok{## 1  Subject (Intercept)  <NA> 1378.1785 37.12383}
\NormalTok{## 2 Residual        <NA>  <NA>  960.4566 30.99123}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The variance partition coefficient is simply the variance at a given
level of the model, divided by the total variance (the sum of the
variance parameters). So we can write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(random.intercepts.model) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{as_data_frame}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\NormalTok{## 1  Subject 0.5893089}
\NormalTok{## 2 Residual 0.4106911}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{Intraclass correlations were computed from the mixed effects mode. 59\%
of the variation in outcome was attributable to differences between
subjects, \(\chi^2(1) = 107\), \emph{p} \textless{} .001.}

estimate from an lmer model. If this is important to you, you should

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3 level models with `partially

The \texttt{lme4::InstEval} dataset records University lecture
evaluations by students at ETH Zurich. The variables include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{s} a factor with levels 1:2972 denoting individual students.
\item
  \texttt{d} a factor with 1128 levels from 1:2160, denoting individual
  professors or lecturers.
\item
  \texttt{studage} an ordered factor with levels 2 \textless{} 4
  \textless{} 6 \textless{} 8, denoting student's ``age'' measured in
  the semester number the student has been enrolled.
\item
  \texttt{lectage} an ordered factor with 6 levels, 1 \textless{} 2
  \textless{} \ldots{} \textless{} 6, measuring how many semesters back
  the lecture rated had taken place.
\item
  \texttt{service} a binary factor with levels 0 and 1; a lecture is a
  ``service'', if held for a different department than the lecturer's
  main one.
\item
  \texttt{dept} a factor with 14 levels from 1:15, using a random code
  for the department of the lecture.
\item
  \texttt{y} a numeric vector of ratings of lectures by the students,
  using the discrete scale 1:5, with meanings of `poor' to `very good'.
\end{itemize}

For convenience, in this example we take a subsample of the (fairly
large) dataset:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We run a model without any predictors, but respecting the clustering in
the data, in the example below. This model is a three-level random
intercepts model, which splits the variance between lecturers, students,
and the residual variance. Because, in some cases, some of the same
students provide data on a particular lecturer these data are `partially

lecturer).

And we can add predictors to the model to see if they help explain
student ratings:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here we can see the \texttt{service} variable does predict evaluations,
and we can use the model to estimate the mean and SE for service == 1 or
service == 0 (see also the sections on
\protect\hyperlink{multiple-comparisons}{multiple comparisons},
\protect\hyperlink{contrasts}{followup contrasts}, and doing
\protect\hyperlink{contrasts-lmer}{followup contrasts with lmer models}

Many of the \protect\hyperlink{contrasts-examples}{contrasts possible

multilevel models. Instead of the \texttt{lsmeans} package we can use
the \texttt{lsmeansLT} function in the \texttt{lmerTest} package.

Let's say we repeat one of the models used in a previous section,
looking at the effect of \texttt{Days} of sleep deprivation on reaction

{[}One quirk of \texttt{lsmeansLT} is that you can't tell R that a
variable is a factor \emph{within} a formula.

So the model
\texttt{lmer(Reaction\textasciitilde{}factor(Days)+(1\textbar{}Subject),\ data=lme4::sleepstudy)}
would run perfectly well, and we could even use it with
\texttt{lsmeansLT} to get cell means, but would fail if we later tried
to calculate contrasts. This is why in the example we transform
\texttt{Days} to be a factor in in a copy of the dataframe, and then run
the model.{]}\{.tip\}

\subparagraph{}\label{section-19}

We can see a significant effect of \texttt{Days} in the Anova table, and
want to compute followup tests.

To first estimate cell means and create an \texttt{lsmeans} object, you
can use the \texttt{lsmeans()} function in the \texttt{lsmeans::}

It might be nice to extract these estimates and plot them:

\includegraphics{multilevel-models_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-32-1.pdf}

If we wanted to compare each day against every other day (i.e.~all the
pairwise comparisons) we can use \texttt{contrast()}:

Or we might want to see if there was a significant change between any
consecutive days (it doesn't look like there was):

\begin{Shaded}

Perhaps more interesting in this example is to check the polynomial
contrasts, to see if there was a linear or quadratic change in RT over
days:

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

It's common, when variances and covariances are close to zero, that
\texttt{lmer} has trouble fitting your model. The solution is to
simplify complex models, removing of constraining some random effects.

For example, in an experiment where you have multiple \texttt{stimuli}
and different experimental \texttt{condition}s, with many repeated
\texttt{trial}s, you might end up with data like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{df }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{()}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 6 x 5}
\NormalTok{##   trial condition block subject       RT}
\NormalTok{##   <int>     <int> <int>   <int>    <dbl>}
\NormalTok{## 1     1         1     1       1 300.8379}
\NormalTok{## 2     2         1     1       1 299.2759}
\NormalTok{## 3     3         1     1       1 300.6742}
\NormalTok{## 4     4         1     1       1 299.5173}
\NormalTok{## 5     5         1     1       1 299.7643}
\NormalTok{## 6     6         1     1       1 300.3312}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Which you could model with \texttt{lmer} like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{m1 <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(RT }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{block }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{trial }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{condition }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(block}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{condition}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{subject), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can list the random effects from the model using the
\texttt{VarCorr} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(m1)}
\NormalTok{##  Groups   Name        Std.Dev.  Corr         }
\NormalTok{##  subject  (Intercept) 0.9923367              }
\NormalTok{##           block       0.0071373 -0.312       }
\NormalTok{##           condition   0.0160946 -0.403 -0.744}
\NormalTok{##  Residual             0.9973866}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As \texttt{VarCorr} shows, this model estimates: - random intercepts for
\texttt{subject}, - random slopes for \texttt{trial} and
\texttt{condition}, and - three covariances between these random
effects.

If these covariances are very close to zero though, as is often the
case, this can cause convergence issues, especially if insufficient data
are available.

If this occurs, you might want to simplify the model. For example, to
remove all the covariances between random effects you might rewrite the
model this way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{m2 <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(RT }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{block }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{trial }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{condition }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{subject) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{block}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{subject) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{condition}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{subject), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{df)}
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(m2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To remove only covariances with the intercept:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{m3 <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(RT }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{block }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{trial }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{condition }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{subject) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{block}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{condition}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{subject), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{df)}

\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(m3)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In general, the recommendation is to try and fit a full random effects
structure, and simplify it by removing the least theoretically plausible
parameters. See:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This tutorial on mixed models in linguistics:
  \url{http://www.bodowinter.com/tutorial/bw_LME_tutorial2.pdf}
\item
  \citet{barr2013random}, which recommends you `keep it maximal',
  meaning that you should keep all random effects terms, including
  covariances, where this is possible.

\subsection*{Path models}\label{path-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Path models}

Path models are an extension of linear regression, but where multiple
observed variables can be considered as `outcomes'.

Because the terminology of outcomes v.s. predictors breaks down when
variables can be both outcomes and predictors at the same time, it's
normal to distinguish instead between:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Exogenous} variables: those which are not predicted by any other
\item
  \emph{Endogenous} variables: variables which do have predictors, and
  may or may not predict other variales
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Defining a model}\label{defining-a-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Defining a model}

To define a path model, \texttt{lavaan} requires that you specify the
relationships between variables in a text format. A full
\href{http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html}{guide to this lavaan
model syntax} is available on the project website.

For path models the format is very simple, and resembles a series of
linear models, written over several lines, but in text rather than as a
\protect\hyperlink{formulae}{model formula}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# define the model over multiple lines for clarity}
\NormalTok{mediation.model <-}\StringTok{ "}
\StringTok{  y ~ x + m}
\StringTok{  m ~ x}
\StringTok{"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this case the \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} symbols just means
`regressed on' or `is predicted by'. The model in the example above
defines that our outcome \texttt{y} is predicted by both \texttt{x} and
\texttt{m}, and that \texttt{x} also predicts \texttt{m}. You might
recognise this as a \protect\hyperlink{mediation}{mediation model}.

{Make sure you include the closing quote symbol, and also be careful
when running the code which defines the model. RStdudio can sometimes
get confused and only run some of the lines, leading to errors. The
simplest solution is to select the entire block explicitly and run
that.}

To fit the model we pass the model specification and the data to the
\texttt{sem()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mediation.fit <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{sem}\NormalTok{(mediation.model, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mediation.df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As we did for \protect\hyperlink{linear-models-simple}{linear regression
models}, we have saved the model fit object into a variable, here named
\texttt{mediation.fit}.

To display the model results we can use \texttt{summary()}. The key
section of the output to check is the table listed `Regressions', which
lists the regression parameters for the predictors for each of the
endogenous variables.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

From this table we can see that both \texttt{x} and \texttt{m} are
significant predictors of \texttt{y}, and that \texttt{x} also predicts
\texttt{m}. This implie that mediation is taking place, but

testing indirect effects in \texttt{lavaan}.

\paragraph{Where's the intercept?}\label{wheres-the-intercept}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Where's the intercept?}

Path analysis is part of the set of techniques often termed `covariance
modelling'. As the name implies the primary focus here is the
relationships between variables, and less so the mean-structure of the
variables. In fact, by default the software first creates the covariance
matrix of all the variables in the model, and the fit is based only on
these values, plus the sample sizes (in early SEM software you typically
had to provide the covariance matrix directly, rather than working with
the raw data).

Nonetheless, because path analysis is an extension of regression
techniques it is possible to request that intercepts are included in the
model, and means estimated, by adding \texttt{meanstructure=TRUE} to the
\texttt{sem()} function
(\href{http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/means.html}{see the
\texttt{lavaan} manual for details}).

In the output below we now also see a table labelled `Intercepts' which
gives the mean values of each variable \emph{when it's predictors are
zero} (just like in linear regression):

If you want to present results from these models in table format, the
\texttt{parameterEstimates()} function is useful to extract the relevant
numbers as a dataframe. We can then manipulate and present this table as
we would any other dataframe.

In the example below we extract the parameter estimates, select only the
regression parameters (\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}) and remove some of
the columns to make the final output easier to read:

Because describing path, CFA and SEM models in words can be tedious and
difficult for readers to follow it is conventional to include a diagram
of (at least) your final model, and perhaps also initial or alternative
models.

The \texttt{semPlot::} package makes this relatively easy: passing a
fitted \texttt{lavaan} model to the \texttt{semPaths()} function
produces a line drawing, and gives the option to overlap raw or
standardised coefficients over this drawing:

\subsubsection*{Defining the model}\label{defining-the-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Defining the model}

As noted above, to define models in \texttt{lavaan} you must specify the
relationships between variables in a text format. A full
\href{http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html}{guide to this lavaan
model syntax} is available on the project website.

For CFA models, like path models, the format is fairly simple, and
resembles a series of linear models, written over several lines.

In the model below there are three latent variables, \texttt{visual},
\texttt{writing} and \texttt{maths}. The latent variable names are
followed by =\textasciitilde{} which means `is manifested by', and then
the observed variables, our measures for the latent variable, are
listed, separated by the \texttt{+} symbol.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{hz.model <-}\StringTok{ '}
\StringTok{visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3}
\StringTok{writing =~ x4 + x5 + x6}
\StringTok{maths =~ x7 + x8 + x9'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we have saved our model specification/syntax in a variable
named \texttt{hz.model}.

The other special symbols in the \texttt{lavaan} syntax which can be
used for CFA models are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{a\ \textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\ b}, which represents a
  \emph{covariance}.
\item
  \texttt{a\ \textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}\ a}, which is a
  \emph{variance} (you can think of this as the covariance of a variable
  with itself)
\end{itemize}

To run the analysis we again pass the model specification and the data
to the \texttt{cfa()} function:

\begin{Shaded}

The output has three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Parameter estimates. The values in the first column are the
  standardised weights from the observed variables to the latent
  factors.
\item
  Factor covariances. The values in the first column are the covariances
  between the latent factors.
\item
  Error variances. The values in the first column are the estimates of
  each observed variable's error variance.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Plotting models}\label{plotting-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Plotting models}

As before, we can use the \texttt{semPaths()} function to visualise the
model. This is an important step because it helps explain the model to
others, and also gives you an opportunity to check you have specified
your model correctly.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{cfa-sem_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf}

And for `final' models we might want to overplot model parameter
estimates (in this case, standardised):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# std refers to standardised estimates. "par" would plot}
\CommentTok{# the unstandardised estimates}

\subsection*{Model fit}\label{model-fit}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Model fit}

To examine the model fit we use \texttt{fitmeasures()} and pass a list
of the names of the fit indices we would like calculated:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(lavaan)}
\KeywordTok{fitmeasures}\NormalTok{(hz.fit, }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'cfi'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'rmsea'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'rmsea.ci.upper'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'bic'}\NormalTok{)) }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This looks OK, but the fit indices indicate the model could be improved.
In particular the RMSEA figure is above 0.05. See the
\protect\hyperlink{gof}{notes on goodness of fit statistics} for more
detail.

\subsection*{Modification indices}\label{modification-indices}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Modification indices}

To examine the modification indices we type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{modificationindices}\NormalTok{(hz.fit)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But because this function produces a very long table of output, it can
be helpful to sort and filter the rows to show only those model
modifications which might be of interes to us.

The command below converts the output of \texttt{modificationindices()}
to a dataframe. It then:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sorts the rows by the \texttt{mi} column, which represents the change
  in model \(\chi^2\) we see if the path was included (see
  \protect\hyperlink{sorting}{sorting})
\item
  Filters the results to show only those with \(\chi^2\) change
  \textgreater{} 5
\item
  Selects only the \texttt{lhs}, \texttt{op}, \texttt{rhs}, \texttt{mi},
  and \texttt{epc} columns.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{lhs} (left hand side), \texttt{rhs} (right hans side) and
\texttt{op} (operation) columns specify what modification should be
made.

Latent factor to variable links have \texttt{=\textasciitilde{}} in the
`op' column. Error covariances for observed variables have
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}} as the op. These symbols
match the symbols used to describe a path in the lavaan model syntax.

If we add the largest MI path to our model it will look like this:

RMSEA has improved somewhat, but we'd probably want to investigate this
model further, and make additional improvements to it (although see the
notes on \protect\hyperlink{model-improvement}{model improvements})

\hypertarget{model-improvement}{\subsection*{Model modification and
improvement}\label{model-improvement}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Model modification and improvement}

Modification indices are a way of improving your model by identifying
parameters which, if included, would improve model fit (or constraints
removed). However, remember that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use of modification indices should be informed by theory
\item
  MI may suggest paths which don't make substantive sense
\end{itemize}

{It's very important to avoid adding paths in a completely data-driven
way because this is almost certain to lead to
\protect\hyperlink{over-fitting}{over-fitting}.}

It's also important to work one step at a time, because the table of
modification indices may change as you add additional paths. For
example, the path second largest MI value may change once you add the
path with the largest MI to the model.

The basic steps to follow are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Run a simple, theoretically-derived model
\item
  Notice it fits badly
\item
  Add any additional paths which make theoretical sense
\item
  Check GOF; If it still fits badly then,
\item
  Run MI and identify the largest value
\item
  If this parameter makes theoretical sense, relax the constraint
\item
  Re-run the model and return to step 4
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sem}{\subsection*{Structural eqution modelling
(SEM)}\label{sem}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Structural eqution modelling (SEM)}

Combining Path models and CFA to create structural equation models (SEM)
allows researchers to combine allow for measurment imperfection whilst
also (attempting to) infer information about causation.

SEM involves adding paths to CFA models which are, like predictors in
standard regression models, are assumed to be causal in nature;
i.e.~rather than variables \(x\) and \(y\) simply covarying with one
another, we are prepared to make the assumption that \(x\) causes \(y\).

It's worth pointing out though, right from the offset, that \emph{causal
relationships drawn from SEM models always dependent on assumptions we
are prepared to make when setting up our model}. There is nothing
magical in the technique that makes allows us to infer causality from
non-experimental data (although note SEM can be used for some
experimental analyses).

It is only be our substantive knowledge of the domain that makes any
kind of causal inference reasonable, and when using SEM the onus is
always \emph{on us} to check our assumptions, provide sensitivity
analyses which test alternative causal models, and interpret
observational data cautiously.

{[}Note, there are techniques which use SEM as a means to make stronger
kinds of causal statements, for example
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable}{instrumental
variable analysis}, but even here, inferring causality still requires
that we make strong assumptions about the process which generated our
data.

Nonetheless, with these caveats in mind, SEM can be a useful technique
to quantify relationships been observed variables where we have
measurement error, and especially where we have a theoretical model
linking these observations.

\paragraph{Steps to running an SEM}\label{steps-to-running-an-sem}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Steps to running an SEM}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Identify and test the fit of a \emph{measurement model}. This is a CFA
  model which includes all of your observed variables, arranged in
  relation to the latent variables you think generated the data, and
  where covariances between all these latent variables are included.
  This step many include \protect\hyperlink{model-improvement}{many
  rounds of model fitting and modification}.
\item
  Ensure your measurement model \protect\hyperlink{gof}{fits the data
  adequately} before continuing. Test alternative or simplified
  measurements models and report where these perform well (e.g.~are
  close in fit to your desired model). SEM models that are based on a
  poorly fitting measurment model will produce parameter estimates that
  are imprecise, unstable or both, and you should not proceed unless an
  adequately fitting measrement model is founds
  (\href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/143465/}{see this nice
  discussion, which includes relevant references}).
\item
  Convert your measurement model by removing covariances between latent
  variables, and including new structural paths. Test model fit, and
  interpret the paths of interest. Avoid making changes to the
  measurement part of the model at this stage. Where the model is
  complex consider adjusting \emph{p} values to allow for multuple
  comparisons (if using NHST).
\item
  Test alternative models (e.g.~with paths removed or reversed). Report
  where alternatives also fit the data.
\item
  In writing up, provide sufficient detail for other researchers to
  replicate your analyses, and to follow the logic of the ammendments
  you make. Ideally share your raw data, but at a minimum share the
  covariance matrix. Report GOF statistics, and
  \protect\hyperlink{XXXTODO}{follow published reporting guidelines for
  SEM}. Always include a diagram of your final model (at the least).
\end{enumerate}

We start by fitting a measurement model. The model sytax includes lines
with

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{=\textasciitilde{}} separatatig left and right hand side (to
  define the latents)
\item
  \texttt{\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}} to specify latent
  covariances
\end{itemize}

We are not including \texttt{exercise} and \texttt{intention} yet
because these are observed variables only (we don't have multiple
measurements for them) and so they don't need to be in the measurement
model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mes.mod <-}\StringTok{ ' }
\StringTok{  # the "measurement" part, defining the latent variables}
\StringTok{  AT =~ a1 + a2 + a3 + sn1}
\StringTok{  SN =~ sn1 + sn2 + sn3 + sn4}
\StringTok{  PBC =~ pc1 + pc2 + pc3 + pc4 + pc5}
\StringTok{  }
\StringTok{  # note that lavaan automatically includes latent covariances}
\StringTok{  # but we can add here anyway to be explicit}
\StringTok{  AT ~~ SN}
\StringTok{  SN ~~ PBC}
\StringTok{  AT ~~ PBC}
\StringTok{'}

And we can assess model fit using \texttt{fitmeasures}. Here we select a
subset of the possible fit indices to keep the output manageable.

This model looks pretty good (see the

check \protect\hyperlink{model-improvement}{modification indices to

However, in this case unless we had substantive reasons to add the
paths, it would probably be reasonable to continue with the original
model.

\subparagraph{Measurement model fits, so proceed to
SEM}\label{measurement-model-fits-so-proceed-to-sem}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Measurement model fits, so proceed
to SEM}

Our SEM model adapts the CFA (measurement model), including additional
observed variables (e.g.~intention and exercise) and any relevant
structural paths:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sem.mod <-}\StringTok{ ' }
\StringTok{  # this section identical to measurement model}
\StringTok{  AT =~ a1 + a2 + a3 + sn1}
\StringTok{  SN =~ sn1 + sn2 + sn3 + sn4}
\StringTok{  PBC =~ pc1 + pc2 + pc3 + pc4 + pc5}

\StringTok{  # additional structural paths}
\StringTok{  intention ~ AT + SN + PBC}
\StringTok{  exercise ~ intention}
\StringTok{'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can fit it as before, but now using the \texttt{sem()} function
rather than the \texttt{cfa()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sem.mod.fit <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{cfa}\NormalTok{(sem.mod, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{tpb.df)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first thing we do is check the model fit:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{fitmeasures}\NormalTok{(sem.mod.fit, useful.fit.measures)}
\NormalTok{##     chisq     rmsea       cfi       aic }
\NormalTok{##   185.866     0.062     0.921 20651.995}
\end{Highlighting}

Of these suggested paths, the largest MI is for the one which says PBC
is predicted by exercise. However, the model would also be improved by
allowing PBC to predict exercise. Which should we add?

\textbf{\emph{The answer will depend on both previous theory and
knowledge of the data.}}

If it were the case that exercise was measured at a later time point
than PBC. In this case the decision is reasonably clear, because the
temporal sequencing of observations would determine the most likely
path. These data were collected contemporaneously, however, and so we
can't use our \emph{design} to differentiate the causal possibilities.

Another consideration would be that, by adding a path from exercise to
PBC we would make the \protect\hyperlink{identification-recursion}{model
non-recursive}, and likely
\protect\hyperlink{identification}{non-identified}.

A theorist might also argue that because previous studies, and the
theory of planned behaviour itself, predict that PBC may exert a direct
influence on behaviour, we should add the path with the smaller MI (so
allow PBC to predict exercise).

In this case, the best course of action would probably be to report the
theoretically implied model, but also test alternative models in which
causal relations between the variables are reversed or otherwise altered
(along with measures of fit and key parameter estimates). The discussion
of your paper would then make the case for your preferred account, but
make clear that the data were (most likely) unable to provide a
persuasive case either way, and that alternative explanations cannot be
ruled out.

\subparagraph{Interpreting and presenting key
parameters}\label{interpreting-and-presenting-key-parameters}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Interpreting and presenting key
parameters}

One of the best ways to present estimates from your final model is in a
diagram, because this is intutive and provides a simple way for readers
to comprehend the paths implied by your model.

We can automatically generate a plot from a fitted model using
\texttt{semPaths()}. Here, the
\texttt{what=\textquotesingle{}std\textquotesingle{}} is requesting
standardised parameter estimates be shown. Adding \texttt{residuals=F}
hides variances of observed and latent variables, which are not of
interest here. The line thicknesses are scaled to represent the size
parameter itself:

\hypertarget{identification}{\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{`Identification'
in CFA and SEM}{Identification in CFA and SEM}}\label{identification}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{`Identification' in CFA and SEM}

Identification refers to the idea that a model is `estimable', or more
specifically whether there is a single best solution for the parameters
specified in the model. An analogy would be the `line of best fit' in
regression - if we could draw two lines that fit the data equally well
then our method doesn't enable us to choose between these possibilities,
and is essentially meaningless (or uninterpretable, anyway).

This is a complex topic, but David Kenny has an excellent page here
which covers identification in lots of detail:
\url{http://davidakenny.net/cm/identify.htm}. Some of the key ideas to
takeaway are:

\hypertarget{identification-recursion}{\paragraph{}\label{identification-recursion}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Feedback loops and other non-recursive models are likely to cause
  problems without special attention.
\item
  Latent variables need a scale. To do this either fix their variance,
  or fix a factor loading to 1.
\item
  You need `enough data'. Normally this will be at least 3 measured
  variables per latent. Sometimes 2 is enough, provided the errors of
  these variables are uncorrelated, but you may struggle to fit models
  because of `empirical under-identification'\footnote{Note, indicators
    themselves should be correlated with one another in a bivariate
    correlation matrix. It's only the errors which should be
    uncorrelated.}
\item
  If a model is non-identified, it may either i) fail to run or, worse,
  ii) produce spurious results.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Rule B}\label{rule-b}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Rule B}

For structural models, `Rule B' also applies when deciding when a model
is identified: No more than one of the following statements should be
true about variables or latents in your model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  X directly causes Y
\item
  Y directly causes X
\item
  X and Y have a correlated disturbance
\item
  X and Y are correlated exogenous variables
\end{itemize}

But see \url{http://davidakenny.net/cm/identify_formal.htm\#RuleB} for a
proper explanation.

\subsection*{Missing data}\label{cfa-sem-missing-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Missing data}

If you have missing data you can use the \texttt{missing\ =\ "ML"}
argument to ask lavaan to estimate the `full information maximum
likelihood' (see \url{http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/est.html}).

\hypertarget{gof}{\subsection*{Goodness of fit statistics in
CFA}\label{gof}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Goodness of fit statistics in CFA}

It's worth noting that many `goodness of fit' statistics are misnamed
and are in fact indexing `badness of fit'. This applies to RMSEA,
\(\chi^2\), BIC, AIC and others.

However all of these indices are trying to solve similar problems in
subtly different ways. The problem is that we would like a model which:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fits the data we have \emph{and also}
\item
  Predicts new data
\end{itemize}

You might think that these goals would be aligned and that a model which
fits the data we have would also be good ad predicting new data, but
this isn't the case. In fact, if we
\protect\hyperlink{over-fitting}{overfit} our current data we won't be
able to predict new observations very accurately.

\paragraph{How fit indices work}\label{how-fit-indices-work}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{How fit indices work}

There is a tradeoff involved to avoid over-fitting the data, and most
fit indices attempt to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Quantify how well the model fits the current data but
\item
  Penalise models which use many parameters (i.e.~those in danger of
  overfitting)
\end{itemize}

Each formula for a goodness of fit statistic represents a different
tradeoff between these goals.

\paragraph{}\label{section-20}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

Model fit statistics are useful but can be misleading and misused. See
David Kenny's page on model fit for more details:
\url{http://davidakenny.net/cm/fit.htm}

\hypertarget{common-fit-indices}{\paragraph{}\label{common-fit-indices}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

Below are some of the most useful and commonly reported GOF statistics
for CFA and SEM models:

\paragraph{Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA)}\label{root-mean-square-error-of-approximation-rmsea}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA)}

MacCallum, Browne and Sugawara (1996) have used 0.01, 0.05, and 0.08 to
indicate excellent, good, and mediocre fit, respectively.

RMSEA \textless{} .05 often used as a cutoff for a reasonably fitting
model, athough others suggest .1.

RMSEA is also used to calculate the `probability of a close fit' or
pclose statistic --- this is the probability that the RMSEA is under
0.05.

\paragraph{Comparative fit index (CFI)}\label{comparative-fit-index-cfi}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Comparative fit index (CFI)}

CFI (and the related TLI) assesses the relative improvement in fit of
your model compared with the baseline model.

CFI ranges between 0 and 1.

The conventional (rule of thumb) threshold for a good fitting model is
for CFI to be \textgreater{} .9

\paragraph{Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information
Criterion
(BIC)}\label{akaike-information-criterion-aic-and-bayesian-information-criterion-bic}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)}

The AIC and BIC are measures of comparative fit, so can be used when
models are non-nested (and therefore otherwise not easily comparable).

AIC is particularly attractive because it corresponds to a measure of
\emph{predictive} accuracy. That is, selecting the model with the
smallest AIC is one way of asking: ``which model is most likely to
accurately predict new data?''

\paragraph{Factors which can influence fit
statistics}\label{factors-which-can-influence-fit-statistics}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Factors which can influence fit
statistics}

All of the following can influence or bias fit statistics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Number of variables (although note RMSEA trends to reduce with more
  parameters included, but other fit statistics will increase).
\item
  Model complexity (different statistics reward parsimony to different
  degrees).
\item
  Sample size (varies by statistic: some increase and others decrease
  with sample size).
\item
  Non-normality of outcome data will (tend to) worsen fit.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Which statistics should you
report?}\label{which-statistics-should-you-report}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Which statistics should you report?}

When reporting absolute model fit, RMSEA and CFI are the most widely
reported, and are probably sufficient.

However, you should almost never just report a single model, and so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When comparing nested models you should report the \(\chi^2\)
  \texttt{lrtest}.
\item
  When comparing non-nested models you should also report differences in
  BIC and AIC.
\end{itemize}

Or if you'd like the Bayes Factor (evidence ratio) for one hypotheses vs
another, for example comparing the hypotheses that a parameter is
\textgreater{} vs. \textless{}= 0, then you can use the
\texttt{hypothesis} function in the \texttt{brms} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pain.model.mcmc.df <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{pain.model.mcmc }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

                   \StringTok{"liked1 > 0"}\NormalTok{,}
                   \StringTok{"familiar1:liked1 < 0"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{## Hypothesis Tests for class :}
\NormalTok{##                        Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Evid.Ratio}
\NormalTok{## (familiar1) > 0            0.20      0.13    -0.02      Inf      14.09}
\NormalTok{## (liked1) > 0               0.30      0.13     0.07      Inf      69.18}
\NormalTok{## (familiar1:liked1) < 0    -0.18      0.14     -Inf     0.04       9.84}
\NormalTok{##                        Star}
\NormalTok{## (familiar1) > 0            }
\NormalTok{## (liked1) > 0              *}
\NormalTok{## (familiar1:liked1) < 0     }
\NormalTok{## ---}
\NormalTok{## '*': The expected value under the hypothesis lies outside the 95% CI.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here although we only have a `significant' p value for one of the
parameters, we can also see there is ``very strong'' evidence that
familiarity also influences pain, and ``strong'' evidence for the
interaction of familiarity and liking, according to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor\#Interpretation}{conventional
rules of thumb when interpreting Bayes Factors}.

TODO - add a fuller explanation of why
\protect\hyperlink{mutiple-comparisons}{multiple comparisons} are not an
issue for Bayesian analysis \citep{gelman2012we}, because \emph{p}
values do not have the same interpretation in terms of long run
frequencies of replication; they are a representation of the weight of
the evidence in favour of a hypothesis.

TODO: Also reference Zoltan Dienes Bayes paper.

\section{Power analysis}\label{power-analysis}

\subsubsection*{For most inferential
statistics}\label{for-most-inferential-statistics}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{For most inferential statistics}

If you want to do power analysis for a standard statistical test,
e.g.~t-tests, chi\textsuperscript{2} or Anova, the \texttt{pwr::}
package is what you need.
\href{http://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html}{This guide has a good
walkthrough}.

\subsubsection*{For multilevel or generalised linear
models}\label{for-multilevel-or-generalised-linear-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{For multilevel or generalised
linear models}

If you'd like to run power analyses for linear mixed models
(\protect\hyperlink{multilevel-models}{multilevel models}) then you need
\href{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12504/full}{the
\texttt{simr::} package}. It has some neat features for calculating
power by simulating data and results from a model you specify.

To take a simple example, let's fabricate some data where outcomes
\texttt{y} are nested within groups \texttt{g}, and where there is a
covariate of interest \texttt{x}. That is, we are interested in
estimating our power to detect an effect of \texttt{x}.

Note though that in this simulated data, we create outcomes (\texttt{y})
with no relationship to \texttt{x}, and no clustering by \texttt{g} at
this stage (i.e. \texttt{y}, \texttt{x} and \texttt{g} are
uncorrelated).

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{power-analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

To use \texttt{simr::} we first run our `model of interest'. In this
case it's a random-intercepts
\protect\hyperlink{multilevel-models}{multilevel model}. We can verify
\texttt{x} is unrelated to outcome with \texttt{lmerTest::anova}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(lmerTest)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Attaching package: 'lmerTest'}
\NormalTok{## The following object is masked from 'package:lme4':}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{##     lmer}

\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{##     step}
\NormalTok{model.of.interest <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lmer}\NormalTok{(y }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{x }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{|}\NormalTok{g), }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{simulated.df)}
\KeywordTok{anova}\NormalTok{(model.of.interest)}
\NormalTok{## Analysis of Variance Table of type III  with  Satterthwaite }
\NormalTok{## approximation for degrees of freedom}
\NormalTok{##     Sum Sq  Mean Sq NumDF DenDF F.value Pr(>F)}
\NormalTok{## x 0.077811 0.077811     1    98 0.07641 0.7828}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The next step is to modify our saved model of interest. We tweak the
fitted parameters to represent our predicted values for effect sizes,
variances, and covariances.

First, let's change the `true' effect of \texttt{x} to be 0.2:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{fixef}\NormalTok{(model.of.interest)[}\StringTok{'x'}\NormalTok{] <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We now use the \texttt{powerSim} function to use our tweaked model to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  create a dataset using the parameters of our model (i.e.~make random
  draws of \texttt{y} which relate to \texttt{g} and \texttt{x} as
  specified in the model summary).
\item
  re-run \texttt{lmer} on this simulated data.
\item
  repeat this hundreds or thousands of times
\item
  count how many times (i.e., for what proportion) we get a significant
  \emph{p} value
\end{itemize}

We might also want to set one of the variance parameters of our model to
represent clustering within-\texttt{g}. First we can use
\texttt{VarCorr()} to check the variance parameters of the model we just
ran:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(model.of.interest)}
\NormalTok{##  Groups   Name        Std.Dev.  }
\NormalTok{##  g        (Intercept) 1.1165e-08}
\NormalTok{##  Residual             1.0091e+00}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we could simulate increasing the variance parameter for \texttt{g}
to 0.5:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{VarCorr}\NormalTok{(model.of.interest)[}\StringTok{'g'}\NormalTok{] <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{power.sim <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{powerSim}\NormalTok{(model.of.interest, }\DataTypeTok{nsim=}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}

Because the amount of clustering in our data has increased our
statistical power has gone down. This is because, when clustering is
present, each new observation (row) in the dataset provides less new
\emph{information} to estimate our treatment effect. Note that in this
example we increased the variance associated with \texttt{g} by quite a
lot: setting the variance of \texttt{g} to 0.5 equates to an ICC for
\texttt{g} of .33 (because .5 / (.5 + 1) = .33; see the section on
\protect\hypertarget{icc-and-vpc}{}{calculating ICCs and VPCs})

For more details of \texttt{simr} see:
\url{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12504/full}

{Note that for real applications you would want to set \texttt{nsim} to
something reasonably large. Certainly at least 1000 simulations, and
perhaps up to \textasciitilde{}5000.}

\section{Learning key patterns}\label{learning-key-patterns}

Statistics courses teach statistics, and software training or
programming courses can teach you the fundamentals of a particular
package --- for example R.

However, a large part of learning how to analyse data is actually not
about particular statistical techniques, nor the detals of implementing
them in a particular package.

Instead, the most useful things to take away from a course can be how to
think about different types of problem, and general strategies for
tackling them. One label applied to these approaches and strategies are
`patterns'.

We've already come across one pattern in the section on
\href{summarising-data}{summarising data}: the
\protect\hyperlink{split-apply-combine}{split, apply, combine method}.

This section outlines some other patterns or ways of working that may be
helpful.

\hypertarget{understanding-interactions}{\section{Unpicking
interactions}\label{understanding-interactions}}

Objectives of this section:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Clarify/recap what an interaction is
\item
  Appreciate the importance of visualising interactions
\item
  Compare different methods of plotting interactions in raw data
\item
  Visualise interactions based on statistical model predictions
\item
  Deal with cases where predictors are both categorical and continuous
  (or a mix)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{What is an interaction?}\label{what-is-an-interaction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{What is an interaction?}

For an interaction to occur we must measure:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An \emph{outcome}: severity of injury in a car crash, for example.
\item
  At least 2 \emph{predictors} of that outcome: e.g.~age and gender.
\end{itemize}

Let's think of a scenario where we've measured severity of injury after
road accidents, along with the age and gender of the drivers involved.
Let's assume\footnote{This example is loosely based on figures reported
  by \citet{kockelman2002driver}}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Women are likely to be more seriously injured than men in a crash (a
  +10 point increase in severity)
\item
  Drivers over 60 are more likely to injured than younger drivers (+10
  point severity vs \textless{}60 years)
\end{itemize}

For an interaction to occur we have to show that, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you ware old and also female then you will be more severely injured
\item
  This increase in severity of injury is more than we would expect
  simply by adding the effects for being female (+10 points) and for
  being over 60 (+10 points). That is, if an interaction occurs the risk
  of being older and female is \textgreater{} a 20 point increase in
  severity.
\end{itemize}

{Think of some other example of interactions from your own work.}

{Interactions capture the idea that the \emph{effect} of one predictor
changes depending on the value of another predictor.}

\subsubsection*{Visualising interactions from raw
data}\label{visualising-interactions-from-raw-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Visualising interactions from raw
data}

In the previous section we established that interactions capture the
idea that the \emph{effect} of one predictor changes depending on the
value of another predictor.

We can see this illustrated in the traditional bar plot below. In the
left panel we see a dummy dataset in which there is no interaction; in
the right panel are data which do show evidence of an interaction:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{interactions_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}Bar plot of injury severity by age and
gender.}
\end{figure}

Howeber this bar plot might be better if it were re-drawn as a point and
line plot:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{interactions_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-4}Point and line plot of injury severity
by age and gender.}
\end{figure}

The reason the point and line plot improves on the bars for a number of
reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Readers tend to misinterpret bar plots by assuming that values `above'
  the bar are less likely than values contained `within' the bar, when
  this is not the case \citep{newman2012bar}.
\item
  The main effects are easy to distinguish in the line plot: just ask
  yourself if the lines are horizontal or not, and whether they are
  separated vertically. In contrast, reading the interaction from the
  bar graph requires that we average pairs of bars (sometimes not
  adjacent to one another) and compare them - a much more difficult
  mental operation.
\item
  The interaction is easy to spot: Ask yourself if the lines are
  parallel. If they \emph{are} parallel then the \emph{difference}
  between men and women is constant for individuals of different ages.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{pain-music-data}{\subsubsection*{A painful
example}\label{pain-music-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{A painful example}

Before setting out to \emph{test} for an interaction using some kind of
statistical model, it's always a good idea to first visualise the
relationships between outcomes and predictors.

A student dissertation project investigated the analgesic quality of
music during an experimental pain stimulus. Music was selected to be
either \emph{liked} (or disliked) by participants and was either
\emph{familiar} or unfamiliar to them. Pain was rated without music
(\texttt{no.music}) and with music (\texttt{with.music}) using a 10cm
visual analog scale anchored with the labels ``no pain'' and ``worst
pain ever''.

\NormalTok{painmusic }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{glimpse}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Observations: 112
## Variables: 4
## $ liked      <fctr> Disliked, Disliked, Liked, Disliked, Liked, Liked,...
## $ familiar   <fctr> Familiar, Unfamiliar, Familiar, Familiar, Familiar...
## $ no.music   <dbl> 4, 4, 6, 5, 3, 2, 6, 6, 7, 2, 7, 3, 5, 7, 6, 3, 7, ...
## $ with.music <dbl> 7, 8, 7, 3, 3, 1, 6, 8, 9, 8, 7, 5, 7, 8, 4, 5, 4, ...
\end{verbatim}

Before running inferential tests, it would be helpful to see if the data
are congruent with the study prediction that \emph{liked} and
\emph{familiar} music would be more effective at reducing pain than
disliked or unfamiliar music

We can do this in many different ways. The most common (but not the
best) choice would be a simple bar plot, which we can create using the
\texttt{stat\_summary()} function from \texttt{ggplot2}.

This gives a pretty clear indication that something is going on, but we
have no idea about the \emph{distribution} of the underlying data, and
so how much confidence we should place in the finding. We are also
hiding distributional information that could be useful to check that
assumptions of models we run later are also met (for example of equal
variances between groups).

If we want to preserve more information about the underlying
distribution we can use density plots, boxplots, or pointrange plots,
among others.

Here we use a grouped density plot. The \texttt{interaction()} function
is used to automatically create a variable with the 4 possible groupings
we can make when combining the\texttt{liked} and \texttt{familiar}
variables:

The advantage of these last two plots is that they preserve quite a bit
of infrmation about the variable of interest. However, they don't make
it easy to read the main effects and interaction as we saw for the
point-line plot above.

We can combine some benefits of both plots by adding an error bar to the
point-line plot:

\includegraphics{interactions_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf}

This plot doesn't include all of the information about the distribution
of effects that the density or boxplots do (for example, we can't see
any asymmetry in the distributions any more), but we still get some
information about the variability of the effect of the experimental
conditions on pain by plotting the SE of the mean over the top of each
point\footnote{We could equally well plot the 95\% confidence interval
  for the mean, or the interquartile range)}

At this point, especially if your current data include only categorical
predictors, you might want to move on to the section on
\href{predictions-and-margins.html}{making predictions from models} and
visualising these.

\hypertarget{predictions-and-margins}{\section{Making
predictions}\label{predictions-and-margins}}

Objectives of this section:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Distingish predicted means (predictions) from predicted effects
  (`margins')
\item
  Calculate both predictions and marginal effects for a \texttt{lm()}
\item
  Plot predictions and margins
\item
  Think about how to plot effects in meaningful ways
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Predictions vs margins}\label{predictions-vs-margins}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Predictions vs margins}

Before we start, let's consider what we're trying to achieve in making
predictions from our models. We need to make a distinction between:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Predicted means
\item
  Predicted effects or \emph{marginal effects}
\end{itemize}

Consider the example used in a previous section where we measured
\texttt{injury.severity} after road accidents, plus two predictor
variables: \texttt{gender} and \texttt{age}.

\subsubsection*{Predicted means}\label{predicted-means}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Predicted means}

`Predicted means' (or predictions) refers to our best estimate for each
category of person we're interested in. For example, if \texttt{age}
were categorical (i.e.~young vs.~older people) then might have 4
predictions to calculate from our model:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.10\columnwidth}\centering\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.11\columnwidth}\centering\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.08\columnwidth}\centering\strut

\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

And as before, we might plot these data:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{predictions-and-margins_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}Point and line plot of injury severity
by age and gender.}
\end{figure}

This plot uses the raw data, but these points could equally have been
estimated from a statistical model which adjusted for other predictors.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Effects}
(margins)}{Effects (margins)}}\label{effects-margins}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\emph{Effects} (margins)}

Terms like: \emph{predicted effects}, \emph{margins} or \emph{marginal
effects} refer, instead, to the effect of one predictor.

There may be more than one marginal effect because \emph{the effect of
one predictor can change across the range of another predictor}.

Extending the example above, if we take the difference between men and
women for each category of age, we can plot these differences. The steps
we need to go through are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reshape the data to be wide, including a separate column for injury
  scores for men and women
\item
  Subtract the score for men from that of women, to calculate the effect
  of being female
\item
  Plot this difference score
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}

\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{geom_hline}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{yintercept =} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{margins.plot}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{predictions-and-margins_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

As before, these differences use the raw data, but \emph{could} have
been calculated from a statistical model. In the section below we do
this, making predictions for means and marginal effects from a
\texttt{lm()}.

\subsubsection*{Continuous predictors}\label{continuous-predictors-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Continuous predictors}

In the examples above, our data were all categorical, which mean that it
was straightforward to identify categories of people for whom we might
want to make a prediction (i.e.~young men, young women, older men, older
women).

However, \texttt{age} is typically measured as a continuous variable,
and we would want to use a grouped scatter plot to see this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{injuries }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(age, severity.of.injury, }\DataTypeTok{group=}\NormalTok{gender, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{gender)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{scale_color_discrete}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{name=}\StringTok{""}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{predictions-and-margins_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

But to make predictions from this continuous data we need to fit a line
through the points (i.e.~run a model). We can do this graphically by
calling \texttt{geom\_smooth()} which attempts to fit a smooth line
through the data we observe:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{injuries }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(age, severity.of.injury, }\DataTypeTok{group=}\NormalTok{gender, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{gender)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{alpha=}\NormalTok{.}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{size=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{se=}\NormalTok{F)}\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{scale_color_discrete}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{name=}\StringTok{""}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{predictions-and-margins_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-7}Scatter plot overlaid with smooth
best-fit lines}
\end{figure}

And if we are confident that the relationships between predictor and
outcome are sufficiently \emph{linear}, then we can ask ggplot to fit a
straight line using linear regression:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{injuries }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(age, severity.of.injury, }\DataTypeTok{group=}\NormalTok{gender, }\DataTypeTok{color=}\NormalTok{gender)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{alpha =}\NormalTok{ .}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{size =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{se =}\NormalTok{ F, }\DataTypeTok{linetype=}\StringTok{"dashed"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_smooth}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{method =} \StringTok{"lm"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{se =}\NormalTok{ F) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{scale_color_discrete}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{name=}\StringTok{""}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{predictions-and-margins_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-8}Scatter plot overlaid with smoothed
lines (dotted) and linear predictions (coloured)}
\end{figure}

What these plots illustrate is the steps a researcher might take
\emph{before} fitting a regression model. The straight lines in the
final plot represent our best guess for a person of a given age and
gender, assuming a linear regression.

We can read from these lines to make a point prediction for men and
women of a specific age, and use the information about our uncertainty
in the prediction, captured by the model, to estimate the likely error.

To make our findings simpler to communicate, we might want to make
estimates at specific ages and plot these. These ages could be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Values with biological or cultural meaning: for example 18 (new
  driver) v.s. 65 (retirement age)
\item
  Statistical convention (e.g.~median, 25th, and 75th centile, or mean
  +/- 1 SD)
\end{itemize}

We'll see examples of both below.

\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{Predicted means and margins using
\texttt{lm()}}{Predicted means and margins using lm()}}\label{predicted-means-and-margins-using-lm}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Predicted means and margins using
\texttt{lm()}}

The section above details two types of predictions: predictions for
means, and predictions for margins (effects). We can use the figure
below as a way of visualising the difference:

the coloured lines in the first. A horizontal line is added at zero in
panel 2 by convention.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Running the model}\label{running-the-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Running the model}

Lets say we want to run a linear model predicts injury severity from
gender and a categorical measurement of age (young v.s. old).

Our model formula would be:
\texttt{severity.of.injury\ \textasciitilde{}\ age.category\ *\ gender}.
Here we fit it an request the Anova table which enables us to test the
main effects and interaction\footnote{Because this is simulated data,
  the main effects and interactions all have tiny p values.}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{injurymodel <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(severity.of.injury }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{age.category }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{gender,  }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{injuries)}
\KeywordTok{anova}\NormalTok{(injurymodel)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Having saved the regression model in the variable \texttt{injurymodel}
we can use this to make predictions for means and estimate marginal
effects:

\subsubsection*{Making predictions for
means}\label{making-predictions-for-means}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Making predictions for means}

When making predictions, they key question to bear in mind is
`predictions for what?' That is, what values of the predictor variables
are we going to use to estimate the outcome?

It goes like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a new dataframe which contains the values of the predictors we
  want to make predictions at
\item
  Make the predictions using the \texttt{predict()} function.
\item
  Convert the output of \texttt{predict()} to a dataframe and plot the
  numbers.
\end{enumerate}

The R \texttt{predict()} function has two useful arguments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{newdata}, which we set to our new data frame containing the
  predictor values of interest
\item
  \texttt{interval} which we here set to confidence\footnote{This gives
    us the confidence interval for the prediction, which is the range
    within which we would expect the true value to fall, 95\% of the
    time, if we replicated the study. We could ask instead for the
    \texttt{prediction} interval, which would be the range within which
    95\% of new observations with the same predictor values would fall.
    For more on this see the section on
    \href{confidence-vs-prediction-intervals.html}{confidence v.s.

\hypertarget{models-are-data-too}{\section{Models are
data}\label{models-are-data-too}}

You might remember the episode of the Simpsons where Homer designs a car
for `the average man'. It doesn't end well. Traditional statistics
packages are a bit like Homer's car. They try to work for everyone, but
in the process become bloated and difficult to use.

This is particularly true of the \emph{output} of software like SPSS,
which by default produces multiple pages of `results' for even
relatively simple statistical models. However, the problem is not just
that SPSS is incredibly verbose.

The real issue is that SPSS views the results of a model as the
\emph{end} of a process, rather than the beginning. The model SPSS has
is something like:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Collect data
\item
  Choose analysis from GUI
\item
  Select relevant figures from pages of output and publish.
\end{enumerate}

This is a problem because in real life it just doesn't work that way. In
reality you will want to do things like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Run the same model for different outcomes
\item
  Re-run similar models as part of a sensitivity analysis
\item
  Compare different models and produce summaries of results from
  multiple models
\end{itemize}

All of this requires an \emph{iterative process}, in which you may want
to compare and visualise the results of multiple models. In a
traditional GUI, this quickly becomes overwhelming.

However, if we treat modelling as a process which \emph{both consumes
and produces data}, R provides many helpful tools.

This is an important insight: in R, the results of analyses are not the
end point --- instead \emph{model results are themselves data}, to be
processed, visualised, and compared.

\subsubsection*{Storing models in
variables}\label{storing-models-in-variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Storing models in variables}

This may seem obvious (and we have seen many examples in the sections
above), but because R variables can contain anything, we can use them to
store the results of our models.

This is important, because it means we can keep track of different
versions of the models we run, and compare them.

\subsubsection*{Extracting results from
models}\label{extract-results-from-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Extracting results from models}

One of the nice things about R is that the \texttt{summary()} function
will almost always provide a concise output of whatever model you send
it, showing the key features of an model you have run.

However, this text output isn't suitable for publication, and can even
be too verbose for communicating with colleagues. Often, when
communicating with others, you want to focus in on the important details
from analyses and to do this you need to extract results from your
models.

Thankfully, there is almost always a method to extract results to a
\protect\hyperlink{datasets-dataframes}{\texttt{dataframe}}. For
example, if we run a linear model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{model.fit <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{disp, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars)}

\NormalTok{## F-statistic: 51.69 on 2 and 29 DF,  p-value: 2.744e-10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can extract the parameter table from this model by saving the
\texttt{summary()} of it, and then using the \texttt{\$} operator to
access the \texttt{coefficients} table (actually a matrix), which is
stored within the summary object.

\begin{Shaded}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{`Poking around' with \texttt{\$}

It's actually a useful trick to learn how to `poke around' inside R
objects using the \texttt{\$} and \texttt{@} operators (if you want the
gory details of how these operators work,
\href{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html}{start with this guide}
to object systems in R).

In the video below, I use RStudio's autocomplete feature to find results
buried within a \texttt{lm} object:

For example, we could write the follwing to extract a table of
coefficients, test statistics and \emph{p} values from an \texttt{lm()}
object (this is shown in the video:

\subsubsection*{Save work: use a Broom}\label{broom}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Save work: use a Broom}

The \href{http://varianceexplained.org/r/broom-intro/}{\texttt{broom::}
library} is worth learning because it makes it really easy to turn model
results into dataframes, which is almost always what we want when
working with data.

It takes a slightly different approach than simply poking around with \$
and @, because it providing general methods to `clean up' the output of
many older R functions.

For example, the \texttt{lm()} or \texttt{car::Anova} functions display
results in the console, but don't make it easy to extract results as a
dataframe. \texttt{broom::} provides a consistent way of extracting the
key numbers from most R objects.

Let's say we have a regression model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(model.}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{ <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(mpg }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(cyl) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{wt }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{disp, }\DataTypeTok{data=}\NormalTok{mtcars))}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Call:}
\NormalTok{## lm(formula = mpg ~ factor(cyl) + wt + disp, data = mtcars)}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## Coefficients:}
\NormalTok{##  (Intercept)  factor(cyl)6  factor(cyl)8            wt          disp  }
\NormalTok{##    34.041673     -4.305559     -6.322786     -3.306751      0.001715}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can extract model fit statistics --- that is, attributes of the model
as a whole --- with \texttt{glance()}. This produces a dataframe:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{glance}\NormalTok{(model.}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##   r.squared adj.r.squared    sigma statistic      p.value df    logLik}
\NormalTok{## 1 0.8375299     0.8134602 2.603054   34.7961 2.726351e-10  5 -73.30158}

\NormalTok{## 1 158.6032 167.3976  182.949          27}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we want to extract information about the model coefficients we can
use \texttt{tidy}:

Because \texttt{broom} always returns a dataframe with a consistent set

comparison. In this plot we see what happens to the regression
coefficients in model 1 when we add \texttt{disp}, \texttt{carb} and

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{APA formatting for free}

A neat trick to avoid
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-finger_error}{fat finger errors}
is to use functions to automatically display results in APA format.
Unfortunately, there isn't a single package which works with all types
of model, but it's not too hard switch between them.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Chi\textsuperscript{2}}{Chi2}}\label{chi2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Chi\textsuperscript{2}}

For basic stats the \texttt{apa::} package is simple to use. Below we
use the \texttt{apa::chisq\_apa()} function to properly format the
results of our chi\textsuperscript{2} test ({[}see the full
chi\textsuperscript{2} example{]}\#crosstabs)):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lego.test <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{chisq.test}\NormalTok{(lego.table)}
\NormalTok{lego.test}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{##  Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction}
\NormalTok{## }
\NormalTok{## data:  lego.table}
\NormalTok{## X-squared = 11.864, df = 1, p-value = 0.0005724}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we can format in APA like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{apa}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{apa}\NormalTok{(lego.test, }\DataTypeTok{print_n=}\NormalTok{T)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "$\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}chi^2$(1, n = 100) = 11.86, *p* < .001"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or using \texttt{apastats::} we also get Cramer's V, a measure of effect
size:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{apastats}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{describe.chi}\NormalTok{(lego.table, }\DataTypeTok{addN=}\NormalTok{T)}
\NormalTok{## [1] "$\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}chi^2$(1, _N_ = 100) = 11.86, _p_ < .001, _V_ = .34"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\paragraph{Inserting results into your text}\label{inline-apa-format}

If you are using RMarkdown, you can drop formatted results into your
text without copying and pasting. Just type the following and the
chi\textsuperscript{2} test result is automatically inserted inline in
your text:

\begin{figure}

\subsection*{Simplifying and re-using}\label{code-reuse}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simplifying and re-using}

Complex programming is beyond the scope of this guide, but if you
sometimes find yourself repeating the same piece of code over and over
then it might be worth writing a simple function.

The examples shown in this book are mostly very simple, and are
typically not repetitive. However in running your own analyses you may
find that you start to repeat chunks of code in a number of places (even
across many files).

Not only is this sort of copying-and-pasting tedious, it can be hard to
read and maintain. For example, if you are repeating the same analysis
for multiple variables and discover an error in your calculations you
would have to fix this is in multiple places in your code. You can also
introduce errors when copying and pasting code in this way, and these
can be hard to spot.

The sorts of tasks which can end up being repetitive include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Running models
\item
  Extracting results from models you run
\item
  Producing tables
\item
  Specifying output settings for graphs
\end{itemize}

In these cases it might be worth writing your own function to facilitate
this repetition, or use some other forms of code re-use (e.g.~see the
\protect\hyperlink{ggplot-reuse}{example for \texttt{ggplot} graphics
below}).

\hypertarget{helper-functions}{\subsubsection*{Writing helper
functions}\label{helper-functions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Writing helper functions}

For example, in the section on logistic regression
\protect\hyperlink{helper-function-logistic}{we wrote a helper function
called \texttt{logistic()}} which was simply a shortcut for
\texttt{glm()} but with the correct `family' argument pre-specified.

For more information on writing your own R functions I recommend
\href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html}{Hadley Wickham's `R for Data
Scientists', chapter 19} and, if necessary,
\href{http://adv-r.had.co.nz}{`Advanced R': http://adv-r.had.co.nz}.

Or you prefer a book, try \citet{grolemund2014hands}.

\hypertarget{ggplot-reuse}{\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Re-using code
with \texttt{ggplot}}{Re-using code with ggplot}}\label{ggplot-reuse}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Re-using code with \texttt{ggplot}}

Another common case where we might want to re-use code is when we
produce a number of similar plots, and where we might want to re-use
many of the same settings.

Sometimes repeating plots is best achieved by creating a single
long-form dataframe and \protect\hyperlink{facetting-plots}{facetting
the plot}. However this may not always be possible or desireable. Lets
say we have two plots like these:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{plot.mpg <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(cyl), mpg)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}

\NormalTok{plot.wt <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(cyl), wt)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And we want to add consistent labels and other settings to them. We can
simply type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myplotsettings <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{xlab}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Number of cylinders"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And then we simply add (\texttt{+}) these settings to each plot:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{plot.mpg }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{myplotsettings}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{simplifying-and-reusing_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

And:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{plot.wt }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{myplotsettings}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{simplifying-and-reusing_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

This reduces typing and makes easier to produce a consistent set of
plots.

\section{(PART) Explanations}\label{part-explanations}

\hypertarget{intervals}{\section{Confidence and
Intervals}\label{intervals}}

Some quick definitions to begin. Let's say we have made an estimate from
a model. To keep things simple, it could just be the sample mean.

A \emph{Confidence interval} is the range within which we would expect
the `true' value to fall, 95\% of the time, if we replicated the study.

A \emph{Prediction interval} is the range within which we expect 95\% of
new observations to fall. If we're considering the prediction interval
for a specific point prediction (i.e.~where we set predictors to
specific values), then this interval woud be for new observations
\emph{with the same predictor values}.

A Bayesian \emph{Credible interval} is the range of values within which
we are 95\% sure the true value lies, based on our prior knowledge and
the data we have collected.

\subsubsection*{The problem with confidence
intervals}\label{the-problem-with-confidence-intervals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{The problem with confidence
intervals}

Confidence intervals are helpful when we want to think about how
\emph{precise our estimate} is. For example, in an RCT we will want to
estimate the difference between treatment groups, and it's conceivable
we would to want to know, for example, the range within which the true
effect would fall 95\% of the time if we replicated our study many times
(although in reality, this isn't a question many people would actually
ask).

If we run a study with small N, intuitively we know that we have less
information about the difference between our RCT treatments, and so we'd
like the CI to expand accordingly.

So --- all things being equal --- the confidence interval reduces as we
collect more data.

The problem with confidence intervals comes about because many
researchers and clinicians read them incorrectly. Typically, they
either:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Forget that the CI represents only the \emph{precision of the
  estimate}. The CI \emph{doesn't} reflect how good our predictions for
  new observations will be.
\item
  Misinterpret the CI as the range in which we are 95\% sure the true
  value lies.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Forgetting that the CI depends on sample
size.}\label{forgetting-that-the-ci-depends-on-sample-size.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Forgetting that the CI depends on
sample size.}

By forgetting that the CI contracts as the sample size increases,
researchers can become overconfident about their ability to predict new
observations. Imagine that we sample data from two populations with the
same mean, but different variability:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we sample 100 individuals from each population the confidence
  interval around the sample mean would be wider in the high variability
  group.
\end{itemize}

If we increase our sample size we would become more confident about the
location of the mean, and this confidence interval would shrink.

But imagine taking a single \emph{new sample} from either population.
These samples would be new grey squares, which we place on the
histograms above. It does not matter how much extra data we have
collected in group B or how sure what the mean of the group is: \emph{We
would always be less certain making predictions for new observations in
the high variability group}.

The important insight here is that \emph{if our data are noisy and
highly variable we can never make firm predictions for new individuals,
even if we collect so much data that we are very certain about the
location of the mean}.

\hypertarget{multiple-comparisons}{\section{Multiple
comparisons}\label{multiple-comparisons}}

People get confused about multiple comparisons and worry about `doing
things right'.

There are many different tests and procedures, and thousands of pages of
tutorials and guides each of which recommends a slightly different
approach. Textbooks typically describe the tests themselves in detail,
and list the assumptions they make, but it sometimes feels like nobody
will give a straight answer.

The inconsistency arises because different researchers have different
priorities. It might help to re-address what a \emph{p} value is, and
what it is \emph{for}.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{\emph{p} values and `false
discoveries'}{p values and false discoveries}}\label{p-values-and-false-discoveries}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\emph{p} values and `false
discoveries'}

In frequentist statistics, \emph{p} values are defined as *the
probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as large as that
observed, if the null hypothesis is true. That is, it's the chance that
the data we have collected are atypical and will mislead us into
thinking there is a difference, when the true effect is zero.

Let's pretend we are creative researchers and, over the course of our
career, we will develop 100 hypotheses, each of which we test in an
experiment, represented by squares in the plot below:

\includegraphics{multiple-comparisons_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

We are concientious and use \protect\hyperlink{power}{sample size
calculations} for our studies, setting our desired power = .8, and use
\emph{p} = .05 as our criterion for rejecting the null hypotheses. As is
common, we report tests which reject the null hypothesis \emph{as if our
predictions had been supported, and the alternative hypotheses were
true} (this is a bad idea, but run with it for the moment).

Let's be generous and say that, in reality, 50\% of our hypotheses are
true (the other 50\% are nice ideas, but are not correct). Because we
set our power to be .8 in our sample size calculation, this means that
over the course of our career we will detect around 40 `true' effects,
and publish them. These are shown in blue in the figure below:

\includegraphics{multiple-comparisons_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

Because we set our alpha level to 0.05, we will also have some false
positives, shown in red:

\includegraphics{multiple-comparisons_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

But what that means is that \emph{for the effects we publish as
supporting our hypotheses} (i.e.~the blue and red squares) then we will
be making false claims 5/40 = 12.5\% of the time. This is obviously much
higher than the nominal alpha level implies. What's more, if we're not
hotshot theorists (or work in an area where theories are less rigorously
developed) and only 20\% of our hypotheses are in fact true then we will
make even more false claims: 5/20 = 25\%.

\subsubsection*{Multiple tests on the same
data}\label{multiple-tests-on-the-same-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Multiple tests on the same data}

Another problem arises when we run multiple statistical tests on the
same data.

The most common case is that we have multiple experimental conditions
and want to test whether any of the differences between them are
significant. If we had experimental 3 groups, then there are 3 possible
comparisons between them, for example (A-B, A-C, B-C). This can be
compounded if we have multiple outcome measurements (for example,
measuring depression \emph{and} anxiety in a clincal trial; see
\citet{feise2002multiple}).

This works like a lucky dip or lottery: if you buy more tickets you have
a larger change of winning a prize. In this case, with three comparisons
between the groups (tickets) we have a 15\% chance of winning a prize,
rather than the 5\% we intended.

Assuming each of our 100 experiments allows for 3 tests, any of which
would be `interesting' if significant (and we would therefore publish
them), then our plot looks like this:

\includegraphics{multiple-comparisons_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

And our `false discovery rate' (at the level of our published papers) is
now over one third: 15/40 = 37.5\%.

\subparagraph{False discovery rates for single
experiments}\label{false-discovery-rates-for-single-experiments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{False discovery rates for single
experiments}

We can also think about a false discovery rate for findings presented
within a particular paper, or set of analyses. Imagine we have a 2x4
factorial design, and so we have 8 experimental groups, and 28 possible
pairwise combinations:

Assuming there are `real' differences between only one-third of these
pairings, then we have the same problem as we did when considering all
the experiments in a researchers' career: Using \emph{p} \textless{} .05
as our criterion, and power of .8 then we will report around 9
significant differences, but 1 or 2 of these will false discoveries
(16\%).

\subsubsection*{What to do about it?}\label{what-to-do-about-it}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{What to do about it?}

There are two decisions you need to make: First, which technique do you
want to use to mitigate the risks of multiple comparisons? Second, what
is the `family' of tests you are going to apply this to?

{If you find the whole language around null hypothesis testing and p
values unhelpful, and the detail of multiple comparison adjustment
confusing, there is another way: Multiple comparison problems are
largely a non-issue for Bayesian analyses \citep{gelman2012we}, and
recent developments in the software make simple models like Anova and
regression \protect\hyperlink{bayes-mcmc}{easy to implement in a
Bayesian framework in R}.}

\paragraph{Which technique?}\label{which-technique}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Which technique?}

Inevitably, it depends!

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If your worry is ever making a type 1 error then you need to
  \emph{control the familywise error rate}. The Bonferroni or Tukey
  correction are likely the best solutions (see details below). Both
  have the disadvantage of increasing the type 2 error rate: you will
  falsely accept the null more frequently, and so neglect findings which
  are `true' and might be theoretically or clinically relevant.
\item
  If your main concern is about the number of `false discoveries' you
  make, and you think it's import to you to avoid rejecting `good'
  hypotheses, then you need a technique to control the \emph{false
  discovery rate}. The Benjamini and Hochberg method, often abbreviated
  as BH or FDR correction, is what you need.
\end{itemize}

Principled arguments can be made for both approaches; there is no
`correct choice'. Which you pick will depend on which concerns are most
pressing to you, and also (inevitably) what is conventional in your
field.

{It's worth noting that in specific fields (for example neuroscience,
where huge numbers of comparisons must be made between voxels or regions
in brain imaging studies) more sophisticated methods to control for
multiple comparisons are often commonplace and expected
\citep{nichols2003controlling}. This guide only deals with some of the
simpler but common cases.}

\paragraph{How big is the family?}\label{how-big-is-the-family}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{How big is the family?}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/large-family.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Whichever technique we employ we do need to determine how many tests we
want to correct for having run; i.e.~what size the `family' of tests is.
Unfortuntately, deciding which set of tests constitutes a `family' is an
unresolved problem, and reasonable people will come up with different
solutions. As \citet{feise2002multiple} put it:

\begin{quote}
It is unclear how wide the operative term ``family'' should be
{[}\ldots{}{]} Does ``family'' include tests that were performed, but
not published? Does it include a meta-analysis upon those tests? Should
future papers on the same data set be accounted for in the first
publication? Should each researcher have a career-wise adjusted p-value,
or should there be a discipline-wise adjusted p-value? Should we publish
an issue-wise adjusted p-value and a year-end-journal-wise adjusted
p-value? Should our studies examine only one association at a time,
thereby wasting valuable resources? No statistical theory provides
answers for these practical issues, because it is impossible to formally
account for an infinite number of potential inferences.
\end{quote}

The `right' answer, then, will vary from case to case, and local
conventions in particular disciplines will dictate what is normal and
expected by supervisors and reviewers. However, there are a few common
cases for which we can make some recommendations on what might constitue
`good practice'. We do not claim that these are the `correct' answers,
but if you deviate from these recommendations it would be worth having a
reasonable justification to hand!

\subparagraph{Multiple outcome
variables}\label{multiple-outcome-variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Multiple outcome variables}

In a clinical trial or other applied study you might want to measure
more than one variable to detect changes across a variety of domains
(e.g.~both depression and anxiety).

Although no firm consensus exists, it is common practice to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Analyse multiple outcomes without correction (and indicate this in the
  text)
\item
  Designate one outcome from the study to be `primary', and report this
  both in pre-trial protocols and reports of the results.
\end{itemize}

See \citet{feise2002multiple} for more details.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{Multiple `timepoints' for the
outcome}{Multiple timepoints for the outcome}}\label{multiple-timepoints-for-the-outcome}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Multiple `timepoints' for the
outcome}

Another common case is where the same outcome variable is measured on
multiple occasions to track progress over time. For example, an RCT
might measure outcome at baseline, at the end of treatment, and again 12
months later.

In the cases where there are only a few measurements of outcome made
then you could choose between:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Bonferroni correction of \emph{p} values for the between-group
  difference at each timepoint or
\item
  Designating one of the timepoints as the `primary' outcome.
\end{enumerate}

In practice option 2 is more common, and probably makes more sense in
applied settings where it is the longer-term prognosis of participants
wich matters most.

\subparagraph{Pairwise comparisons in factorial
designs}\label{pairwise-comparisons-in-factorial-designs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Pairwise comparisons in factorial
designs}

Let's say you have a complex complex factorial design and so multiple
pairwise comparisons and other contrasts are possible.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If you are only interested in a small number of the possible pairwise
  comparisons or specific contrasts then specify this up front. Either
  report the comparisons without correction (noting this in the text) or
  use FDR/Bonferroni correction for this small family of tests.
\item
  If you are only interested in specific main effects or interactions
  from the full factorial model, then you should specify this in advance
  and report these F-tests or t-tests and associated \emph{p} values
  without correction.
\item
  It is perfectly reasonable to be interested only in specific pairwise
  comparisons contained within an Anova F-test. It is normal to report
  the F from the Anova, but it is \emph{not} necessary for the F test to
  be significant before reporting the pairwise comparison of interest
  (with or without FDR/Bonferroni correction).
\item
  If you have not specified the comparisons of interest in advance, then
  use FDR or Tukey correction for the complete set of pairwise tests. If
  you feel able to claim that some of these pairwise comparisons would
  \emph{never} have been of interest then you could reduce the family
  size for this correction accordingly, but you should make this
  justification in your report.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Factorial Anova and pairwise
comparisons}\label{factorial-anova-and-pairwise-comparisons}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Factorial Anova and pairwise
comparisons}

In the \protect\hyperlink{howell-factorial-example}{Anova cookbook}, we
used a dataset from Howell's textbook which recorded \texttt{Recall}
among young v.s. older adults (\texttt{Age}) for each of 5 conditions:

\includegraphics{multiple-comparisons_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

In an ideal world we would have published a trial protocol before
collecting data, or at the least
\protect\hyperlink{register-predictions}{specified which comparisons
were of interest to us}. However for the purposes of this example I'll
assume you didn't do this, and need to address the potential for
mutliple comparisons accordingly.

The design of the study suggests that we were interested in the effect
of the experimental conditions on recall, and we might have predicted
that these experimental manipulations would affect older and younder
adults differently. Because we didn't pre-specify our analyses, we
should acknowledge that we would likly report any differences between
any of the 5 experimental conditions (10 possible comparisons) and any
differences between younger and older adults in any of those conditions
(45 possible pairwise comparisons).

Because replicating this experiment is relatively cheap (testing might
only take 30 minutes per participant), and we are confident that other
labs would want to replicate any significant findings we report, we are
less concerned with the absolute rate of type 1 errors, but would like
to limit our `false discovery rate' (we have a repututation to
maintain). We set our acceptable false discovery rate to 5\%.

We run an Anova model, including main effects for \texttt{Age} and
\texttt{Condition} and their interaction:

We report that there is are significant main effects for Age, Condition,
and a significant interaction for \texttt{Age:Condition}. At this point,
if we hadn't already plotted the raw data, we would certainly want to do
that, or to \protect\hyperlink{understanding-interactions}{make
predictions for each cell in the design and plot them}.

Because the plot of the raw data (see above) suggested that the counting
and rhyming conditions produced lower recall rates than the other
conditions, we might want to report the relevant pairwise tests. We can
use the the \texttt{lsmeans()} function from the \texttt{lsmeans::}
package to compute these:

\begin{Shaded}

By default Tukey correction is applied for multiple comparisons, which
is a reasonable choice. If you wanted to adjust for the false discovery
rate instead, you can use the \texttt{adjust} argument:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# not run, just shown as an example}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The plot also suggested that older and younger adults appeared to differ
for the `adjective', `imagery', and `intention' conditions. We can
compute these detailed pairwise comparisons by including the interaction
term, \texttt{Age:Condition} in the call to \texttt{lsmeans()}:

You should note that the FDR adjusted p values do not represent
probabilities in the normal sense. Instead, the p value now indicates
the \emph{false discovery rate at which the p value should be considered
statistically significant}. So, for example, if the adjusted p value =
0.09, then this indicates the contrast \emph{would} be significant if
the acceptable false discovery rate is 10\%. Researchers often set their
acceptable false discovery rate to be 5\% out of habit or confusion with
conventional levels for alpha, but it would be reasonable to set it to
10\% or even higher in some circumstances. Whatever level you set, you
need to be able to satisfy both yourself and a reviewer that the result
is of interest: the particular values for alpha and FDR you agree on are
arbitrary conventions, provided you both agree the finding is worthy of
consideration!

Extracting pairwise comparisons to display in your report

In the code above we request FDR-adjusted p values, and then use the
\texttt{broom::tidy()} function to convert the table into a dataframe,
and then use \texttt{pander} to display the results as a table. For more
information on extracting results from models and other R objects and
displaying them properly see the section:
\protect\hyperlink{models-are-data-too}{models are data too}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Adjusting for the FDR by hand}

If you have a set of tests for which you want to adjust for the FDR it's
easy to use R's \texttt{p.adjust()} to do this for you.

We can see a number of these different contrasts below. First, we run a

And then we create the \texttt{lsmeans} object:

We can use this \texttt{lsm} object to calculate various contrasts we
might want to see. First, consecutive contrasts where each level is
compared with the next:

Polynomial contrasts allow us to test whether the increase in RT's over
the days is linear or curved:

If we don't specify a contrasts argument, or a type of correction, we
will get Tukey contrasts for every pairwise comparison:

\end{Shaded}

If we want to compare particular levels of \texttt{Days} with a specific
reference level we can use the \texttt{trt.vs.ctrl} contrast type. In
this example we are comparing each day with day 0, because day 0 is the
first in the list of days and we specified \texttt{ref=1} (try running
the comparisons against day 5).

And if we want to compare each level against the grand mean of the
sample, the \texttt{eff} contrast type is short for \texttt{effect}. A
way of thinking of this (in English) is that we are asking `what is the
effect of being on a particular day, relative the other average of all
days'.

\hypertarget{clustering}{\section{Non-independence}\label{clustering}}

Psychological data often contains natural \emph{groupings}. In
intervention research, multiple patients may be treated by individual
therapists, or children taught within classes, which are further nested
within schools; in experimental research participants may respond on
multiple occasions to a variety of stimuli.

Although disparate in nature, these groupings share a common
characteristic: they induce \emph{dependency} between the observations
we make. That is, our data points are \emph{not independently sampled}
from one another.

What this means is that observations \emph{within} a particular grouping
will tend, all other things being equal, be more alike than those from a
different group.

\paragraph{Why does this matter?}\label{why-does-this-matter}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Why does this matter?}

Think of the last quantitative experiment you read about. If you were
the author of that study, and were offered 10 additional datapoints for
`free', which would you choose:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  10 extra datapoints from existing participants.
\item
  10 data points from 10 new participants.
\end{enumerate}

In general you will gain more \emph{new information} from data from a
new participant. Intuitively we know this is correct because an extra
observation from someone we have already studies is \emph{less likely to
surprise us} or be different from the data we already have than an
observation from a new participant.

Most traditional statistical models assume that data \emph{are} sampled
independently however. And the precision of the inferences we can draw
from from statistical models is based on the \emph{amount of information
we have available}. This means that if we violate this assumption of
independent sampling we will trick our model into thinking we have more
information than we really do, and our inferences may be wrong.

\hypertarget{fixed-or-random}{\section{Fixed and random
effects}\label{fixed-or-random}}

As noted by \citet{gelman2005analysis} (and
\href{http://andrewgelman.com/2005/01/25/why_i_dont_use/}{summarised
here}), the terms `fixed' and `random' are used very loosely in both the
methodological and applied literature. Gelman identifies 5 different
senses in which the distinction between fixed and random effects can be
drawn, and this inconsistency can lead to confusion.

\hypertarget{random-slopes-intercepts}{\paragraph{}\label{random-slopes-intercepts}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

For practical purposes, if you think that you have some form of grouping
in your data and that it makes sense to think of variation in outcomes
between these groups then you should probably include it as a random
intercept in your model.

Likewise, if you include a predictor in your model and it is reasonable
to think that the effect of this predictor would vary between groups in
the data (e.g., between individuals) then you should include a random
slope effect for this variable.

\hypertarget{random-intercepts}{\subparagraph{Random
intercepts}\label{random-intercepts}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Random intercepts}

Some example of groupings which should be included as random intercepts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Participants
\item
  Classes and Schools
\item
  Therapists or treatment providers (e.g.~in cluster randomised trial)
\item
  Stimuli or `items'
\end{itemize}

Groupings which are not clear cut in either direction:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A smallish number of experimental conditions which could be thought of
  as `sampled' from a larger population of possible groupings
  \citep{gelman2005analysis}. An example here would be groups which
  recieve different doses of a drug.
\end{itemize}

Examples of groupings which are probably not best handled as random
intercepts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Experimental conditions especially where the conditions are
  qualitatively different (although the interventions might warrant
  inclusion as a random slope, see below).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{random-slopes}{\subparagraph{Random
slopes}\label{random-slopes}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Random slopes}

Where the effect of a variable might vary between individuals (or other
grouping) should be considered for inclusion as a random slopes. Some
examples might include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Time (or some function of time)
\item
  An experimental intervention (e.g.~in a factorial design)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{link-functions}{\section{Link
functions}\label{link-functions}}

Standard regression models are linear combinations which allow predicted
values to range between negative -∞ (infinity) and +∞.

If you think about it, this makes sense, because there is no bound on
either the parameters we fit (the regression coefficients) or the
predictor values.

Where outcome data are continuous and (in theory or if we make a
reasonable assumption) this isn't a problem.

However for binary or count data this isn't the case.

For binary data we want to predict the probability of a positive
response, and this can range between zero and 1.

For count data, predicted outcomes must always be non-negative
(i.e.~zero or greater).

Logistic and poisson regression extend regular linear regression to
allow this to happen by using different `link functions'.

These link functions transform the data, which are constrained to 0/1 or
non-negative integers, to the range of the underlying linear model,
which allows values between -∞ and +∞.

So, in generalised linear regression our linear combination is
predicting a transformed outcome.

\subsubsection*{Logistic regression}\label{logistic-link-function}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Logistic regression}

When we have binary data, we want to be able run something like
regression, but where we predict a \emph{probability} of the outcome.

Because probabilities are limited to between 0 and 1, to link the data
with the linear model we need to transform so they range from -∞
(infinity) to +∞.

You can think of the solution as coming in two steps:

\paragraph{Step 1}\label{step-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Step 1}

We can transform a probability on the 0---1 scale to a 0 \rightarrow ∞
scale by converting it to \emph{odds}, which are expressed as a ratio:

\[\textrm{odds} = \dfrac{\textrm{probability}}{1-\textrm{probability}}\]

Probabilities and odds ratios are two \emph{equivalent} ways of
expressing the same idea.

So a probability of .5 equates to an odds ratio of 1 (i.e.~1 to 1);
\emph{p}=.6 equates to odds of 1.5 (that is, 1.5 to 1, or 3 to 2), and
\emph{p} = .95 equates to an odds ratio of 19 (19 to 1).

Odds convert or \emph{map} probabilities from 0 to 1 onto the
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number}{real numbers} from 0 to
∞.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{link-functions_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}Probabilities converted to the odds
scale. As p approaches 1 Odds goes to infinity.}
\end{figure}

We can reverse the transformation too (which is important later)
because:

\[\textrm{probability} = \dfrac{\textrm{odds}}{1+\textrm{odds}}\]

\subparagraph{}\label{section-21}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If a bookie gives odds of 66:1 on a horse, what probability does he
  think it has of winning?
\item
  Why do bookies use odds and not probabilities?
\item
  Should researchers use odds or probabilities when discussing with
  members of the public?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 2}\label{step-2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Step 2}

When we convert a probability to odds, the odds will always be
\textgreater{} zero.

This is still a problem for our linear model. We'd like our `regression'
coefficients to be able to vary between -∞ and ∞.

To avoid this restriction, we can take the \emph{logarithm} of the odds
--- sometimes called the \emph{logit}.

The figure below shows the transformation of probabilities between 0 and
1 to the log-odds scale. The logit has two nice properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  It converts odds of less than one to negative numbers, because the
  \emph{log} of a number between 0 and 1 is always negative{[}\^{}1{]}.
\item
  It flattens the rather square curve for the odds in the figure above,
  and
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

\paragraph{Reversing the process to interpret the
model}\label{reversing-the-process-to-interpret-the-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Reversing the process to interpret the
model}

As we've seen here, the logit or logistic link function transforms
probabilities between 0/1 to the range from negative to positive
infinity.

This means logistic regression coefficients are in log-odds units, so we
must interpret logistic regression coefficients differently from regular
regression with continuous outcomes.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In linear regression, the coefficient is the change the outcome for a
  unit change in the predictor.
\item
  For logistic regression, the coefficient is the \emph{change in the
  log odds of the outcome being 1, for a unit change in the predictor}.
\end{itemize}

If we want to interpret logistic regression in terms of probabilities,
we need to undo the transformation described in steps 1 and 2. To do
this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  We take the exponent of the logit to `undo' the log transformation.
  This gives us the \emph{predicted odds}.
\item
  We convert the odds back to probability.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{A hypothetical example}\label{a-hypothetical-example}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{A hypothetical example}

Imagine if we have a model to predict whether a person has any children.
The outcome is binary, so equals 1 if the person has any children, and 0
otherwise.

The model has an intercept and one predictor, \(age\) in years. We
estimate two parameters: \(\beta_0 = 0.5\) and \(\beta_{1} = 0.02\).

The outcome (\(y\)) of the linear model is the log-odds.

The model prediction is: \(\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\textrm{age}\)

So, for someone aged 30:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the predicted log-odds = \(0.5 + 0.02 * 30 = 1.1\)
\item
  the predicted odds = \(exp(1.1) = 3.004\)
\item
  the predicted probability = \(3.004 / (1 + 3.004) = .75\)
\end{itemize}

For someone aged 40:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the predicted log-odds = \(0.5 + 0.02 * 40 = 1.3\)
\item
  the predicted odds = \(exp(1.3) = 3.669\)
\item
  the predicted probability = \(3.669 / (1 + 3.669) = .78\)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Regression coefficients are odds
ratios}\label{regression-coefficients-are-odds-ratios}

One final twist: In the section above we said that in logistic
regression the coefficients are the \emph{change in the log odds of the
outcome being 1, for a unit change in the predictor}.

Without going into too much detail, one nice fact about logs is that if
you take the log of two numbers and subtract them to take the
difference, then this is equal to dividing the same numbers and then
taking the log of the result:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{A <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{log}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}\OperatorTok{-}\KeywordTok{log}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{) }
\NormalTok{B  <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{log}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}


\CommentTok{# we have to use rounding because of limitations in }
\CommentTok{# the precision of R's arithmetic, but A and B are equal}
\KeywordTok{round}\NormalTok{(A, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{round}\NormalTok{(B, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{## [1] TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This means that \emph{change in the log-odds} is the same as the
\emph{ratio of the odds}

So, once we undo the log transformation by taking the exponent of the
coefficient, we are left with the \emph{odds ratio}.

You can now jump back to \protect\hyperlink{logistic-regression}{running
logistic regression}.

\section{Building and choosing models}\label{comparison-and-selection}

\subsubsection*{Like maps, models are imperfect but
useful}\label{like-maps-models-are-imperfect-but-useful}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Like maps, models are imperfect but
useful}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/map_projections.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Maps are always imperfect, and the decisons we make as we build them
entail different visions of how the world is.

For example, when making maps cartographers must decide at what size to
print it, and how much detail to include. The smaller the map the more
convenient it is to carry, but a smaller map can never represent reality
as accurately. Similarly, we must leave out details to make the map
practical to use; but \emph{what} we omit depends on the planned use of
the map.

Stretching he analogy a little, we could evaluate maps according to
their performance: did the map help us navigate to a desired location,
for example? This is likely to be a function of two things:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Veracity}: that is, how faithfully does the map represent the
  `reality' of the terrain it covers?
\item
  \emph{Simplicity}: does the map include details which are ephemeral,
  or irrelvant to the task in hand?
\end{itemize}

At one extreme, we might take an aerial photo of a city, which would
accurately represent the terrain, but would include many details which
are ephemeral or transient and not necessary to the task of, for
example, finding the city's railway station. Indeed the photo is
literally a snapshot of the city on a given day, and some elements might
be unhelpful in navigating the city several months later; the photo
might include temporary roadworks, for example, which could lead the
reader to assume a street was blocked to traffic when this was not
normally the case. At the other extreme, we might consider a highly
stylised cartoon map of the same city, which includes onlu major roads
and the station itself, but none of the secondary roads or other
landmarks. Here the map is so lacking in detail that it may be hard to
orient ourselves to the actual terrain.

Statistical models are not exactly like maps, but we can evaluate them
using similar criteria. A good model enables the user to make sense of
the data they collect (i.e.~navigate the city) and this involves making
reliable predictions. Reliable predictions are possible when the model
accurately represents the underlying reality of a phenomena, but also
when the model is simple enough to ignore ephemeral or irrelevant
information.

Evaluating and selecting statistical models involves just this kind of
tradeoff between \emph{veracity} and \emph{simplicity}.

To stretch the analogy above, when we collect data, we are taking a
photo of the city, making a snapshot of a given process at a particular
place and time. This snapshot (hopefully) contains valuable information
about how the process works in general, but it also includes noise and
irrelevant information which could distract us, preventing us from using
the data to accurately predict the future.

\hypertarget{over-fitting}{\subsubsection*{Overfitting/underfitting}\label{over-fitting}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Overfitting/underfitting}

To \sout{steal}use a different analogy, imagine you want to predict who
will win the next US presidential election:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{media/xkcd_presidents_overfitting.png}
\caption{Cartoon: xkcd.com}
\end{figure}

In total there have only been 57 presidential elections and 44
presidents in the US, which isn't a lot of data to learn from. The point
of the cartoon is that if we try and include ephemeral predictors like
beards and false teeth then the space of possible combinations becomes
huge. This means that some of these combinations will start to fit the
data because of chance variations, and not because they represent some
fundamental aspect of the process generating the outcome (election
wins).

If you allow statistical models to expand in this way (that is, driven
only by patterns in the data you have) then you will find that,
inevitably, the model fits the data you have, but the you won't be able
to predict \emph{new} data at all.

This is one of the reasons why we prefer simpler models, all other
things being equal. It also explains why practices like stepwise
regression, where we add or remove variables depending on whether they
are `statistically significant',
\href{http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/stepwise-regression-problems/}{are
almost always a bad idea}. We should only accept a complex model
(e.g.~one including false teeth as a predictor of the presidency) if we
have enough evidence to be confident this will predict new data.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Choosing the `right
variables'}{Choosing the right variables}}\label{variable-selection}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Choosing the `right variables'}

As an aside, if you do find yourself in a situation with a large number
of predictors and hope to build a simpler model --- either with the goal
of prediction or theory development --- then it's hopefully obvious from
the discussion above that simply dropping or selecting predictors based
on \emph{p} values is unlikely to lead to good science. Not only will
you tend to over-fit the data you have, but you may also discount valid
predictor variables because of problems like multicollinearity
(correlations between predictors).

In other disciplines where inference from observational data are more
common (e.g.~ecology and biological anthropolgy) the concepts of model
averaging or multimodal inference have gained currency, and may be be
useful to applied psychologists. The core concept is that if we have
several models, all of which are approximately as good as each other,
then we should make predictions and inferences by averaging across the
models, weighting each model by how well it fits the data: that is, we
give the most weight to the best fitting model, but don't completely
discount other models which fit almost as well.

See \citet{mcelreath2016rethinking}, chapter 6, for a good introduction.
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQb7l5IfS0s}{This video explains
the concept well}. The R package
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MuMIn/index.html}{MuMln
package} implements most of the methods needed. See also this

\section{(PART) Loose ends}\label{part-loose-ends}

\section{R in daily life}\label{r-details}

This chapter contains some details omitted in the main text, covering
how to install R and RStudio, and how to install and use useful
packages.

\subsection*{Installation}\label{installation-intro}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Installation}

\paragraph{RStudio Server}\label{rstudio-server}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{RStudio Server}

The simplest way to get started with RStudio is to get an account on a
server installation of the software (if you are a Plymouth University
student please see the guidance on the DLE).

\paragraph{Installing on your own machine.}\label{local-install}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Installing on your own machine.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{Download
  RStudio 1.01 or later} (I'd suggest using whatever version is most
  recent and upgrading as new versions become available because the
  software is fairly actively developed).
\item
  Install the \protect\hyperlink{dependencies}{packages listed below}
\item
  If you want to `knit' your work into a pdf format, you should also
  install LaTeX. On \href{https://miktex.org/download}{windows use this
  installer}. Make sure to do a `full install', not just a basic
  install. On a Mac install \href{https://brew.sh}{homebrew} and type
  \texttt{brew\ cask\ install\ mactex}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{dependencies}{\paragraph{Package
dependencies}\label{dependencies}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Package dependencies}

As noted, this guide uses a number of recent R packages to make learning
R simpler and more consistent. This requires that the packages are
installed first.

To install some of the recommended packages you will need a working C
compiler (XXX Although perhaps not on Windows?).

\href{requirements.R}{This script} installs all dependencies on a recent
Linux or Mac system.

\hypertarget{packages}{\subsection*{Packages}\label{packages}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Packages}

R has been around for a very long time, but has remained popular because
it is easy for people to add new functions to it.

You can run almost any statistical model and produce a wide variety of
graphics in R because people have contributed new functions and these
extend the base language. These new features are distributed in bundles
known as `packages'. For now we'll assume someone has helped you install
all the packages you need\footnote{See the
  \href{installation.html}{installation guide} if this isn't the case}.

To \emph{access} the features in packages, you normally load the package
with the \texttt{library()} function. Running
\texttt{library(\textless{}packagename\textgreater{})} loads all the new
functions within it, and it is then possible to call them from your
code. For example, typing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Will load the \texttt{ggplot2} package. You can then call the
\texttt{qplot} function it provides:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{qplot}\NormalTok{(mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{mpg, }\DataTypeTok{bins=}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{packages_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{package-namespacing}{\paragraph{}\label{package-namespacing}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{}

You don't strictly \emph{need} to load packages to use the features
within them though. If a package is installed on your system you can
also call a function it provides directly. In the example below we call
the \texttt{hist.data.frame} from the \texttt{Hmisc} package, and obtain
histograms of all the variables in the \texttt{mtcars} dataset:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Hmisc}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{hist.data.frame}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{packages_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

The rule is to type \texttt{package::function(parameters)}, where
\texttt{::} separates the package and function names. Parameters are
just the inputs to the function.

There are two reasons not to load a package before using it:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Laziness: it can save typing if you just want to use one function from
  a package, and only once.
\item
  Explicitness: It's an unfortunate fact that some function names are
  repeated across a number of packages. This can be confusing if they
  work differently, and if you don't know which package the version you
  are using comes from. Using \texttt{package\_name:function\_name} can
  help make things explicit.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Quirks of R}\label{quirks}

\hypertarget{rownames}{\subsection*{Rownames are evil}\label{rownames}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Rownames are evil}

Historically `row names' were used on R to label individual rows in a
dataframe. It turned out that this is generally a bad idea, because
sorting and some summary functions would get very confused and mix up
row names and the data itself.

It's now considered best practice to avoid row names for this reason.
Consequently, the functions in the \texttt{dplyr} library remove row
names when processing dataframes. For example here we see the row names
in the \texttt{mtcars} data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##                mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4}
\NormalTok{## Datsun 710    22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But here we don't because \texttt{arrange} has stripped them:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(mpg) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{##    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb}
\NormalTok{## 1 10.4   8  472 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 2 10.4   8  460 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4}
\NormalTok{## 3 13.3   8  350 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Converting the results of \texttt{psych::describe()} also returns
rownames, which can get lots if we sort the data.

We see row names here:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{psych}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{describe}\NormalTok{(mtcars) }\OperatorTok{%>%}

\NormalTok{## # ... with 4 more variables: range <dbl>, skew <dbl>, kurtosis <dbl>,}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But not here (just numbers in their place):

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subparagraph{Preserving row names}\label{preserving-row-names}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subparagraph}{Preserving row names}

If you want to preserve row names, it's best to convert the names to an

\subsubsection{Searching and replacing}\label{searching-and-replacing}

If you want to search inside a string there are lots of useful functions
in the \texttt{stringr::} library. These replicate some functionality in
base R, but like other packages in the `tidyverse' they tend to be more
consistent and easier to use. For example:

Paste can combine character strings with other types of variable to
produce a new vector:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{paste}\NormalTok{(mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{cyl, }\StringTok{"cylinders"}\NormalTok{)[}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{##  [1] "6 cylinders" "6 cylinders" "4 cylinders" "6 cylinders" "8 cylinders"}
\NormalTok{##  [6] "6 cylinders" "8 cylinders" "4 cylinders" "4 cylinders" "6 cylinders"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Which can be a useful way to label graphs:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtcars }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{paste}\NormalTok{(mtcars}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{cyl, }\StringTok{"cylinders"}\NormalTok{), mpg)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{xlab}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{""}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Fixing up \texttt{variable} after
melting}{Fixing up variable after melting}}\label{separate-and-extract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Fixing up \texttt{variable} after
melting}

In this example \texttt{melt()} creates a new column called
\texttt{variable}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sleep.wide }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{melt}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{id.var=}\StringTok{"Subject"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(Subject, variable)  }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{head}
\NormalTok{##   Subject variable    value}
\NormalTok{## 1       1    Day.0 249.5600}
\NormalTok{## 2       1    Day.1 258.7047}
\NormalTok{## 3       1    Day.2 250.8006}
\NormalTok{## 4       1    Day.3 321.4398}
\NormalTok{## 5       1    Day.4 356.8519}
\NormalTok{## 6       1    Day.5 414.6901}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However the contents of \texttt{variable} are now a character string
(i.e.~a list of letters and numbers) rather than numeric values (see
\protect\hyperlink{factors-and-numerics}{column types}) but in this
instance we know that the values \texttt{Day.1}, \texttt{Day.2}\ldots{}
are not really separate categories but actually form a linear sequence,
from 1 to 9.

We can use the \texttt{extract} or \texttt{separate} functions to split
up \texttt{variable} and create a numeric column for \texttt{Day}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sleep.long }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{separate}\NormalTok{(variable, }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"variable"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Day"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{Day=}\KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(Day)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(Subject) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{head }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pander}
\end{Highlighting}

\section{Getting help}\label{getting-help}

If you don't know or can't remember what a function does, R provides
help files which explain how they work. To access a help file for a
function, just type \texttt{?command} in the console, or run
\texttt{?command} command within an R block. For example, running
\texttt{?mean} would bring up the documentation for the \texttt{mean}
function.

You can also type \texttt{CRTL-Shift-H} while your cursor is over any R
function in the RStudio interface.

It's fair to say R documentation isn't always written for beginners.
However the `examples' sections are usually quite informative: you can
normally see this by scrolling right to the end of the help file.

\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{``Table 1''}{Table 1}}\label{table1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{``Table 1''}

Table 1 in reports of clinical trials and many psychological studies
reports characteristics of the sample. Typically, you will want to
present information collected at baseline, split by experimental groups,
including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Means, standard deviations or other descriptive statistics for
  continuous variables
\item
  Frequencies of particular responses for categorical variables
\item
  Some kind of inferential test for a zero-difference between the
  groups; this could be a t-test, an F-statistic where there are more
  than 2 groups, or a chi-squared test for categorical variables.
\end{itemize}

Producing this table is a pain because it requires collating multiple
statistics, calculated from different functions. Many researchers resort
to performing all the analyses required for each part of the table, and
then copying-and-pasting results into Word.

It can be automated though! This example combines and extends many of
the techniques we have learned using the split-apply-combine method.

To begin, let's simulate some data from a fairly standard 2-arm clinical
trial or psychological experiment:

Check our data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{boring.study }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{glimpse}
\NormalTok{## Observations: 280}
\NormalTok{## Variables: 8}

\NormalTok{## $ yob       <dbl> 1983, 1983, 1972, 1974, 1977, 1988, 1979, 1983, 1979...}
\NormalTok{## $ WM        <dbl> 89, 95, 110, 107, 94, 97, 107, 100, 113, 121, 96, 86...}
\NormalTok{## $ education <chr> "Primary", "Graduate", NA, NA, "Postgraduate", "Seco...}
\NormalTok{## $ ethnicity <chr> "Black / African / Caribbean / Black British", "Blac...}
\NormalTok{## $ Attitude  <dbl> 9, 3, 9, 6, 14, 3, 8, 10, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 6, 13, 6, ...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Start by making a long-form table for the categorical variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{boring.study.categorical.melted <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{table1.categorical.Ns <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{boring.study }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(condition, education, ethnicity) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{melt}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{id.var=}\StringTok{'condition'}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then calculate the N's for each response/variable in each group:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(table1.categorical.Ns <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{boring.study.categorical.melted }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(condition, variable, value) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{N=}\KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{()) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{dcast}\NormalTok{(variable}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{value}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{condition, }\DataTypeTok{value.var=}\StringTok{"N"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{##    variable                                       value Control}
\NormalTok{## 1 education                                    Graduate      34}
\NormalTok{## 2 education                                Postgraduate      23}
\NormalTok{## 3 education                                     Primary      20}
\NormalTok{## 4 education                                   Secondary      34}
\NormalTok{## 5 education                                        <NA>      29}
\NormalTok{## 6 ethnicity                       Asian / Asian British      40}
\NormalTok{## 7 ethnicity Black / African / Caribbean / Black British      33}
\NormalTok{## 8 ethnicity              Mixed / multiple ethnic groups      30}
\NormalTok{## 9 ethnicity                               White British      37}
\NormalTok{##   Intervention}
\NormalTok{## 1           33}
\NormalTok{## 2           27}
\NormalTok{## 3           29}
\NormalTok{## 4           28}
\NormalTok{## 5           23}
\NormalTok{## 6           33}
\NormalTok{## 7           34}
\NormalTok{## 8           42}
\NormalTok{## 9           31}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then make a second table containing Chi2 test statistics for each
variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(table1.categorical.tests <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{boring.study.categorical.melted }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(variable) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{do}\NormalTok{(., }\KeywordTok{chisq.test}\NormalTok{(.}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{value, .}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{condition) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{tidy) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\CommentTok{# this purely to facilitate matching rows up below}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{firstrowforvar=}\NormalTok{T))}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 2 x 6}
\NormalTok{## # Groups:   variable [2]}
\NormalTok{##    variable statistic   p.value parameter                     method}
\NormalTok{##      <fctr>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <int>                     <fctr>}
\NormalTok{## 1 education  2.412408 0.4913291         3 Pearson's Chi-squared test}
\NormalTok{## 2 ethnicity  3.215570 0.3595676         3 Pearson's Chi-squared test}
\NormalTok{## # ... with 1 more variables: firstrowforvar <lgl>}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Combine these together:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(table1.categorical.both <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{table1.categorical.Ns }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(variable) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\CommentTok{# we join on firstrowforvar to make sure we don't duplicate the tests}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{firstrowforvar=}\KeywordTok{row_number}\NormalTok{()}\OperatorTok{==}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\CommentTok{# this is gross, but we don't want to repeat the variable names in our table}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{variable =} \KeywordTok{ifelse}\NormalTok{(firstrowforvar}\OperatorTok{==}\NormalTok{T, }\KeywordTok{as.character}\NormalTok{(variable), }\OtherTok{NA}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(variable, value, Control, Intervention, statistic, parameter, p.value))}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 9 x 7}
\NormalTok{##    variable                                       value Control}
\NormalTok{##       <chr>                                       <chr>   <int>}
\NormalTok{## 1 education                                    Graduate      34}
\NormalTok{## 2      <NA>                                Postgraduate      23}
\NormalTok{## 3      <NA>                                     Primary      20}
\NormalTok{## 4      <NA>                                   Secondary      34}
\NormalTok{## 5      <NA>                                        <NA>      29}
\NormalTok{## 6 ethnicity                       Asian / Asian British      40}
\NormalTok{## 7      <NA> Black / African / Caribbean / Black British      33}
\NormalTok{## 8      <NA>              Mixed / multiple ethnic groups      30}
\NormalTok{## 9      <NA>                               White British      37}
\NormalTok{## # ... with 4 more variables: Intervention <int>, statistic <dbl>,}
\NormalTok{## #   parameter <int>, p.value <dbl>}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we deal with the continuous variables. First we make a `long'
version of the continuous data

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{continuous_variables <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"yob"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"WM"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{boring.continuous.melted <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{boring.study }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(condition, continuous_variables) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{melt}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(variable) }
\NormalTok{## Using condition as id variables}

\NormalTok{boring.continuous.melted }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{head}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 6 x 3}
\NormalTok{## # Groups:   variable [1]}
\NormalTok{##   condition variable value}
\NormalTok{##      <fctr>   <fctr> <dbl>}
\NormalTok{## 1   Control      yob  1983}
\NormalTok{## 2   Control      yob  1983}
\NormalTok{## 3   Control      yob  1972}
\NormalTok{## 4   Control      yob  1974}
\NormalTok{## 5   Control      yob  1977}
\NormalTok{## 6   Control      yob  1988}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then calculate separate tables of t-tests and means/SD's:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(table.continuous_variables.tests <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\NormalTok{boring.continuous.melted }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\CommentTok{# note that we pass the result of t-test to tidy, which returns a dataframe}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{do}\NormalTok{(., }\KeywordTok{t.test}\NormalTok{(.}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{value}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{.}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{condition) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{tidy) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(variable, statistic, parameter, p.value))}
\NormalTok{## # A tibble: 2 x 4}
\NormalTok{## # Groups:   variable [2]}
\NormalTok{##   variable  statistic parameter   p.value}
\NormalTok{##     <fctr>      <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>}
\NormalTok{## 1      yob  0.5667085  276.8166 0.5713715}
\NormalTok{## 2       WM -0.1454372  276.2967 0.8844717}

\NormalTok{(table.continuous_variables.descriptives <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\NormalTok{boring.continuous.melted }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(variable, condition) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\CommentTok{# this is not needed here because we have no missing values, but if there }
\StringTok{    }\CommentTok{# were missing value in this dataset then mean/sd functions would fail below,}

\StringTok{    }\CommentTok{# we format the mean and SD into a single column using sprintf. }
\StringTok{    }\CommentTok{# we don't have to do this, but it makes reshaping simpler and we probably want}
\StringTok{    }\CommentTok{# to round the numbers at some point, and so may as well do this now.}
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{transmute}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{MSD =} \KeywordTok{sprintf}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"%.2f (%.2f)"}\NormalTok{, Mean, SD)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{    }\KeywordTok{dcast}\NormalTok{(variable}\OperatorTok{~}\NormalTok{condition))}
\NormalTok{## Adding missing grouping variables: `variable`, `condition`}
\NormalTok{## Using MSD as value column: use value.var to override.}
\NormalTok{##   variable        Control   Intervention}
\NormalTok{## 1      yob 1979.45 (5.01) 1979.12 (4.69)}
\NormalTok{## 2       WM  97.86 (11.10)  98.04 (10.26)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And combine them:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(table.continuous_variables.both <-}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{left_join}\NormalTok{(table.continuous_variables.descriptives, }

\NormalTok{## Joining, by = "variable"}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally put the whole thing together:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

And we can print to markdown format for outputting. This is best done in
a separate chunk to avoid warnings/messages appearing in the final
document.

Some exercises to work on/extensions to this code you might need:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Add a new continuous variable to the simulated dataset and include it
  in the final table
\item
  Create a third experimental group and amend the code to i) include 3
  columns for the N/Mean and ii) report the F-test from a one-way Anova
  as the test statistic.
\item
  Add the within-group percentage for each response to a categorical
  variable.
\end{itemize}
